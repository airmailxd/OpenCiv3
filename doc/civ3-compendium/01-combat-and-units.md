# 1. Combat and units

Scope: base game, Play the World (PTW) and Conquests (C3C), patched (1.29f / PTW 1.27f / C3C 1.22).
Scenarios, mods and the special C3C game modes (Regicide, Elimination, Capture the Princess, victory-point
games) are out of scope. C3C is the target ruleset. Where vanilla or PTW differ, the difference is called out.

Note: the repo file `C7/Civilopedia/Text/Civilopedia.txt` is OpenCiv3's own text ("It is not Civ3's
Civilopedia"), so it is **not** used as a source. The repo's ruleset also carries a `promotionChance` per
experience level; that field is **not** in the BIQ (the BIQ EXPR record holds only a name, base hit points and a
retreat bonus, see `QueryCiv3/BiqSections/Expr.cs`), so it is not a source either.

## 1.1 Combat resolution

- **Four kinds of combat.** Ground/naval combat, bombardment, missile attacks and air combat.
  PEDIA `GCON_Combat`: "There are four types of combat: ground/naval combat, bombardment, missile attacks, and air combat."
- **A battle is fought in rounds until one side has no hit points left; the loser dies, the winner may be damaged.**
  PEDIA `GCON_Combat`: "The two units trade blows until one of them loses its health bar and is destroyed.
  The winner may be damaged (its health bar is reduced)."
- **Each round costs the loser exactly 1 hit point. Civ3 has no firepower.** Every round removes one HP.
  - CFC-CSE (Valant2): "During battle each time the unit loses on a battle roll they loose 1 hp." and
    "If the unit wins the turn, it causes 1hp of damage to the opponent."
  - https://forum.freeciv.org/f/viewtopic.php?p=97232 (Akechi, from memory): "There is no Firepower status in Civ 3. all combat round deals 1 damage to each round loser."
  - Pre-release Firaxis statements on firepower are not available; the Apolyton thread
    https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-general-archive/45717-probability-and-combat (Grunthex)
    says: "Uh, units have between 2 and 5 hp, not 10. Depending on their veterancy."
- **Per-round odds are A / (A + D)**, with A the attacker's modified attack and D the defender's modified defense.
  Community-derived, never confirmed by Firaxis in the sources found.
  - CFC-CSE (Valant2): "Crude Turn Win % = (attackers offensive rating)/ ((attackers offensive rating)+(defenders defensive rating))"
  - https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/made-attacker-win-probability-page.7886/page-2 (Grendel): "the probability of the attacker winning one round (causing a HP loss in the defender) is a/(a+x)."
  - The same thread gives the whole-battle odds as a negative binomial: "(a / (a+x))^y * (x / (a+x))^z * nCr(y+z-1, y-1)", summed over z = 0 .. b-1 (b = attacker HP, y = defender HP, z = rounds the attacker loses).
  - alexman (APO-WALLS #25, Jun 2003, PTW), describing bombardment in terms of normal combat: "Bombardment works like
    normal combat, except that the odds are determined using the bombard strength" / "of the attacking unit, instead of
    its attack strength." / "The defender's strength and modifiers are the same in both cases."
  - Xerxes314's vanilla combat calculator (https://civfanatics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/civ3combatcalc.html, readable
    JavaScript) uses the same model: no firepower, per-round odds from the two strengths, HP 2/3/4/5 and 3x that for armies.
- **C3C beta "less streaky" combat change: announced, but not in the shipped patch notes.** Tavis's patch notice
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ-iii-conquests-patch-notice.71474/, #1, 9 Dec 2003, beta 1.10): "Modified
  combat calculations to make combat appear less "streaky."" and (#13) "The Change was having the random number generator
  (rng) calculate the Results 4 times instead of 1." Tall Stranger (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/107356-1.htm,
  #29, Jan 2004, second-hand): "this 4 roll combat change was never added to the C3C patch." README-C3C (1.20 to 1.22)
  lists no combat-calculation change. Treat 1.22 combat as the single-roll model above.
- **Bombard odds use the same ratio, with bombard strength in place of attack.** EDHELP's own example shows a 50%
  chance at equal values. EDHELP *Building (Defensive Bonuses)*: "a unit with a bombard strength of 4 would have a
  50% chance of destroying a building with a defense rating of 4."
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/bombard-question.19648 (dunk): a bombard-8 cannon against a defense-3 cavalry has "an 8 out of 11 chance of hurting the cavalry."
- **Random seed is saved with the game** (reloading replays the same results) unless the rule is turned off.
  README-V 1.21f: "Added Preserve Random Seed rule. Turning this off will allow random seeds to be changed when a saved game is reloaded (which makes combat different...)."
  Dan Magaha (Firaxis), https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/as-promised-a-civ-iii-combat-test-map.15208/: "the game was designed so that save + reload wouldn't be a very effective or efficient way to cheat"
- **Defender choice: the unit with the highest defense value defends.** EDHELP *Stealth Attack Barrier (Improvement
  Flag)* describes a normal attack as hitting "the defending unit currently with the highest defense value". Players
  found that current HP also counts, so a healthy weaker unit can defend before a badly damaged stronger one:
  - https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-strategy-archive/83449-why-do-offensive-units-defend-before-defensive-ones
    (Dec 2002): Dominae, "The game will always select the unit in a stack that has the best chances at winning a combat
    on defense." / "This is a combination of Defense value and HPs."; IthacaMike, "I've always figured that it was HPs
    times Defense."; theNiceOne, "But notice that factors like fortifying counts."
  - DeepO (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/59461-1.htm, Aug 2002): "defense goes to that unit who has the
    highest combination of HPs and Defense stat".
  - Ties (community, untested): IthacaMike, "In case of ties the defender seems to be the unit with the lowest Attack.";
    bongo, "In ties the weakest attacker will defend."; Dominae and theNiceOne guess the cheapest unit.
  - Ships (Soren Johnson, Firaxis, second-hand via Jaybe in thread 83449): "if there are two ships of same defensive
    strength (e.g., two transports), the one withOUT cargo will defend."
  - The exact weighting of defense against HP is UNVERIFIED (no test or code reading found).
- **Units without attack can't attack; units without defense are captured, not fought** (see 1.13).
- **Stealth attack lets the attacker pick its target in a stack** (C3C). PEDIA `GCON_Stealth_Attack`: "Stealth
  attack allows a unit to specify which enemy unit -- in a stack -- it will attack." Submarines have it
  (PEDIA `PRTO_Submarine`: "Submarines have $LINK<Stealth Attack=GCON_Stealth_Attack>").
- **Collateral damage** (C3C ability). EDHELP *Create Craters and Collateral Damage*: if the defender "takes damage,
  then: If the defending unit is not in a city, the artillery/bombard value of the attacking unit is used to conduct
  a bombard attack on that space to determine if any terrain improvements are also destroyed. If the defending unit is
  in a city, the the artillery/bombard value of the attacking unit is used to conduct a bombard attack on that city".
- **Craters** (C3C). PEDIA `GCON_Craters`: "When a bombardment attack which eliminates the last unit or terrain
  improvement in a square, a crater may be formed. Like pollution, the presence of craters reduces a square's
  production, commerce, and food output by one."
- **"Starts Golden Age" units.** EDHELP *Unit Abilities*: "If victorious in combat, this unit triggers a golden age".

### Healing

- **1 HP per turn, only in friendly or neutral territory, only if the unit does not move.**
  PEDIA `GCON_Combat`: "adding one $LINK<block=GCON_Experience> per turn back to its health bar. To do so, it
  ^* must be in friendly or neutral territory. ^* must not move for a complete turn."
- **Full heal in one turn:** ground units in a city with Barracks, ships with a Harbor, air units with an Airport.
  PEDIA `GCON_Combat`: "A city with a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> heals ground units completely in one turn." (same wording for Harbor and Airport).
- **Battlefield Medicine** (small wonder, needs 5 Hospitals) allows healing in enemy territory.
  PEDIA `BLDG_Battlefield_Medicine`: "Allows military units to heal in enemy territory. ^{Requires:} The civilization must have at least five hospitals".
- **A city without a Barracks heals 2 HP per turn.** BIQ heal-rate table: `friendly_field 1, neutral_field 1,
  hostile_field 0, city 2`. CFC-FAQ (Ginger_Ale): "If the unit is in a city, but it has no barracks, it will heal 2 Hit
  Points per turn;". Theoden (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/question-concerning-healing-units.113864/, #10, 2005):
  "I can confirm. Unts will always heal 2pts in cities." Quintillus
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/fortification.266551/, #7, 2008): "Military units inside cities without
  barracks/harbor/airport heal at 2 damage per turn." Whether fortifying matters is disputed in thread 113864 (shadow2k:
  1 unfortified, 2 fortified; k-a-bob: "Fortification has no effect."); the BIQ has no such field.
- **Upgrading a unit heals it fully** (community). Pyrrhos (thread 266551, #9): "Now there remains only one, rarely used,
  way to heal even redlined troops in one turn to mention - to upgrade them." massa (thread 113864, #3), on the
  no-move rule for healing: "Exceptions are upgrades and promotions."
- **Ships heal only in port; in C3C their passengers heal at sea** (community). The Professor (thread 266551, #2):
  "Ships can only heal in port". PaperBeetle (same thread, #11, C3C): passengers heal aboard; "To get this healing, you
  need to be in friendly or neutral waters." UNVERIFIED by a test.

## 1.2 Experience and hit points

- **Hit points by experience level.** BIQ EXPR and PEDIA agree.

  | Level | HP (blocks) | Retreat bonus (BIQ) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Conscript | 2 | 34 |
  | Regular | 3 | 50 |
  | Veteran | 4 | 58 |
  | Elite | 5 | 66 |

  PEDIA `GCON_Experience`: "Conscripts 2 ^Regulars 3 ^Veterans 4 ^Elite units 5".
- **Unit HP bonus** (editor, since 1.21f): added to the level's base HP, from -20 to +20, never below 1 HP. All stock
  units have 0 (UNVERIFIED for every unit; the BIQ `hpBonus` field is 0 for the units checked).
  EDHELP *HP Bonus*: "This bonus is added to the base hitpoint value (determined by the unit's experience level) ...
  the unit's total number of HP will never drop below 1."
- **What produces each level.** Cities build regulars; a Barracks (Harbor for ships, Airport for planes) builds
  veterans; draft and barbarian-hut units are conscripts; elite only comes from combat.
  PEDIA `GCON_Experience`: "Normally, cities produce regulars. But if a city has a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks>, it
  produces [veterans]. ... [Elite units] cannot be built: they gain this status only through actual combat experience."
  PEDIA `BLDG_Harbor` / `BLDG_Airport`: "produce $LINK<veteran=GCON_Experience> naval units" / "air units instead of regulars."
  Sun Tzu's Art of War gives a Barracks in every city on its continent (PEDIA `BLDG_Art_of_War`: "Puts a $LINK<barracks=BLDG_Barracks> in every city on the same continent.").
- **Battlefield promotion after a win.** PEDIA `GCON_Experience`: "When one of your units is victorious in battle,
  there is a chance it will gain combat experience and be promoted to the next level." The chances are not in the
  Civilopedia or BIQ. Community figures:

  | Promotion | Non-militaristic | Militaristic |
  |---|---|---|
  | Conscript to Regular | 1/2 | doubled |
  | Regular to Veteran | 1/4 | 1/2 |
  | Veteran to Elite | 1/8 | 1/4 |

  - https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/barbarians-gaining-experience.115547 (Theoden, #18): odds roughly 1 in 2,
    1 in 4 and 1 in 8, "Double the chances for militaristic civs and halve them when fighting barbarians."
  - https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/heroic-epic-militaristic-civs.26455 (Catt, #2): "A veteran militaristic
    unit has a 1 in 4 chance of being promoted to elite after a victorious battle against an AI civ." and "A veteran
    non-militaristic unit has a 1 in 8 chance." Catt (#6) credits this to a Soren Johnson post that is not reproduced.
  - PEDIA `GCON_Strengths` (Militaristic): "combat $LINK<experience=GCON_Experience> is gained more quickly."
  - CFC-FAQ (Ginger_Ale) gives the full table, saying the chance "depends on 3 things" (current level, Militaristic,
    barbarian opponent): non-militaristic 1 in 2 / 1 in 4 / 1 in 8, halved against barbarians (1 in 4 / 1 in 8 / 1 in
    16); militaristic 1 in 1 / 1 in 2 / 1 in 4, and 1 in 2 / 1 in 4 / 1 in 8 against barbarians. So a militaristic
    conscript that wins against a civ always becomes a regular. No source for the table is given.
  - Counter-claim from code reading (CFC-LCODE, Antal1987, #8, C3C 1.22): "Promotion of unit's combat experience doesn't
    depends on Civ having Militaristic flag as well." He was reading the leader routine, so this may only mean the
    militaristic check is elsewhere. See Disputed.
  - watorrey (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/57625-1.htm, 2002, opinion): "any unit winning 2 battles in one
    turn is automatically promoted". No test; UNVERIFIED.
- **Barbarians do not promote** (C3C 1.22 test). Same thread 115547 (Theoden, #14, C3C 1.22): "all dying without any of the mech infs gaining any experience." This is about barbarian units gaining levels, not about your units promoting while fighting barbarians (see Disputed).
- **A damaged unit keeps its level.** Experience is the level, not the current HP. A veteran at 2/4 HP is still a
  veteran for retreat and promotion. Apolyton (Ethelred) https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-general-archive/75784-fast-units-no-longer-retreating-at-low-health: "The editor's retreat setting is for the experience level not the hit points."
- **A unit makes at most one leader, until it is upgraded. Units that made a leader are marked.** README-V 1.29f:
  "Added an '*' next to experience level name for units that have produced a leader." The rule, relayed by alexman as
  something "Mike B. (Firaxis) confirmed" (APO-1GL #1, May 2002), quoted by nato (#11): "Each unit can produce at most
  one great leader." / "Each time a unit is upgraded, however, it can once again produce a great leader." The C3C code
  skips the leader roll for a unit that is "already extra elite" (CFC-LCODE #1). An upgraded elite drops to veteran
  (see 1.14), so it must be promoted again before it can make a second leader
  (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/90368-1.htm, CerberusIV: "if you later upgrade the unit it goes back to
  being veteran and can again be promoted to Elite").

## 1.3 Great Leaders (military)

- **A leader can appear when an elite unit wins a battle.** PEDIA `GCON_Leaders`: "A {Military leader} is born in
  combat. This [can] occur when an $LINK<elite unit=GCON_Experience> wins a battle."
- **Chance per elite win: 1/16; 1/12 with the Heroic Epic; half that when the win is on defense.** Not in the BIQ or
  Civilopedia. The C3C 1.22 executable confirms it (CFC-LCODE, Antal1987, #1): "Military leader appears if random(0,
  Ratio) == 0. That means the odds = 1 / Ratio." / "Ratio = 4 \* (Small\_Wonder\_Count <= 0) + 12, where
  Small\_Wonder\_Count is count of Small Wonders" / "with flag "Increases\_Chance\_Of\_Leader\_Appearance"" / "If the
  combat is defence, Ratio doubles". That gives 1/16 attacking, 1/12 attacking with the Heroic Epic, 1/32 and 1/24 on
  defense (#7: "Minimum is 1 / 32, when you don't have required small wonder and a unit is in defense."). The 4 and 12
  are hard-coded (#8). Community figures agree:
  - CFC-LEAD: "Each time one of your elite units wins a fight against a rival, there is a 1 in 16 chance that a leader will appear." / "your chance of getting a leader improves to 1 in 12 when you win a fight with an elite." / "The chances of getting a leader from a successful defense are 1/2 the chances while attacking."
  - https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-play-the-world/80836-how-a-leader-is-born (Catt): "The chance of a leader generation is 1/12, 1/16, 1/24, or 1/32, depending on circumstances".
  - PEDIA `BLDG_Epic`: "Increases the chances of the appearance of $LINK<leaders=GCON_Leaders> from victorious combat."
- **When no leader can appear (C3C 1.22 code).** CFC-LCODE (Antal1987, #1) lists the cases that skip the roll: "if the
  unit is not elite" / "if it is naval or air" / "if it kills barbarian unit" / "if it is already extra elite" / "if
  it is inside an army" / "if current battle created unit count > 0; Default battle created unit type is "Leader"".
  So in C3C **elite ships and planes never make leaders**. Moosezilla (#14) recalls a leader from a naval battle in
  older PTW games; Puppeteer (#15) answers that PTW and C3C differ. Whether naval leaders were possible before C3C is
  UNVERIFIED.
- **No leaders from fighting barbarians.** CFC-LEAD: "You can not get a leader by fighting a barbarian." Confirmed by the
  code list above ("if it kills barbarian unit").
- **The militaristic trait does not change leader odds** (it only raises promotion odds). Thread 26455 (Catt): "The
  odds of leader generation for ALL civs, militaristic or not, is 1/16 without the Heroic Epic". CFC-LCODE (#8): "It
  seems, that there is no checking for militaristic flags of civilizations."
- **Armies do not generate leaders.** Thread 80836 (Catt): "Armies cannot generate leaders." Killing an army can
  (Theseus, same thread: "You can, however, generate a GL by an elite killing an Army."). The C3C code skips the roll
  for a unit "inside an army" (CFC-LCODE).
- **Only one military leader alive at a time.** CFC-LEAD: "You can only have one leader at a time." The rule relayed
  from Firaxis in APO-1GL (#11): "You can have more than one great leader per game but only one at a time." In the C3C
  code the roll is skipped while the civ owns any unit of the Battle-Created Unit type (CFC-LCODE: "if current battle
  created unit count > 0"). CFC-LEAD's "You can however produce more than one leader in one game turn" fits this only if
  the first leader was used (made an army or hurried) before the next elite win; that reading is an inference.
- **Leader unit.** BIQ: Leader costs 0, A/D 0/0, movement 3. The unit the editor spawns is the "Battle Created Unit"
  (CFC-RULES: "Determines which unit is spawned when an elite unit wins a battle."; BIQ `battleCreatedUnit: Leader`).
  A leader cannot fight and is captured or destroyed if caught alone (see 1.13).
- **Uses (C3C): make an army, or finish an improvement or small wonder in the city it is in. It cannot hurry a Great Wonder.**
  PEDIA `GCON_Leaders`: "A Military Leader can be used to either create an $LINK<army=PRTO_Army> or to
  $LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> production of an Improvement or Small Wonder in a city. When a military leader
  does either of these actions he disappears."
- **Vanilla and PTW: leaders hurry anything, including Great Wonders.** PEDIA-V / PEDIA-PTW `GCON_Leaders`: "Leaders
  can be used to either create an $LINK<army=GCON_Armies> or to $LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> production in a city."
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/what-is-a-leader-and-how-do-i-get-one.21132 (Fez_Monk): "Using the leader is
  the only way of hurrying a wonder."
- **C3C scientific leaders** (from being first to a tech) can hurry Great Wonders. They belong with science, not
  combat. PEDIA `GCON_Leaders`: "A Scientific Leader can also be used to $LINK<hurry=GCON_Hurry_Production> the
  construction of any [improvement] (including a Great Wonder)".
- **A unit that makes a leader can be renamed.** README-V: "Added the ability to rename units if they produce a great leader during combat."

---

## 1.4 Armies

- **Capacity 3 units, 4 with the Pentagon. The Pentagon needs 3 armies in the field.**
  PEDIA `BLDG_Pentagon`: "[The Pentagon] increases the unit capacity of all the civilization's armies from three to
  four. ^{Requires:} The civilization must have at least three $LINK<armies=GCON_Armies> in the field." (BIQ Army `capacity 3`.)
- **Built by a leader in any city, or built (400 shields in C3C) in the city with the Military Academy.**
  PEDIA `GCON_Armies`: "Armies can be built in cities that have the $LINK<Military Academy=BLDG_Military_Academy>
  or a $LINK<Leader=GCON_Leaders> in them." BIQ: Army `shieldCost 400`.
  The CivFanatics FAQ v3.0 (https://civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/misc/civilization-iii-faqstrategy-guide-v3-0/)
  says "you can use 200 shields to construct an army". That is probably the vanilla cost (see Disputed).
- **At most one army per 4 cities.** PEDIA `GCON_Armies`: "you must have at least four cities for every army you
  create." EDHELP *Cities Needed to Support an Army*: "Default is 4 cities." CFC-ARMY: dropping below the ratio keeps
  existing armies but blocks new ones.
- **Military Academy and Heroic Epic both need a victorious army first.** PEDIA `BLDG_Military_Academy`: "The city with
  the [Military Academy] can build $LINK<armies=GCON_Armies> without the benefit of a $LINK<leader=GCON_Leaders>.
  Armies from this civilization are more effective in combat. ^{Requires:} The civilization must have had a
  victorious $LINK<army=GCON_Armies>." PEDIA `BLDG_Epic` has the same requirement.
- **Units in an army pool their hit points; the whole army must be killed to kill any unit in it.** README-V
  ("Changes" from the manual): "Armies now literally share the hit points of the units within it. For example, an
  army of 3 regular spearman would have hit points equal to 9. To kill any unit in the army, the entire army must be
  eliminated."
- **Loading.** Units can be loaded or unloaded only while the army is still in the city that made it; after it leaves,
  the contents are fixed. README-V: "Once that army leaves the city of it's construction, you cannot add or remove
  units from the army." BIQ `allowUnloadFromArmy: false`. Units in an army cannot be upgraded (CFC-ARMY: "Units in
  armies cannot be upgraded."). Only units with both attack and defense can be loaded (CFC-ARMY: "Only combat units
  (those with an attack and defense) can be loaded into an army.").
- **Abilities.** Armies have zone of control and blitz (vanilla 1.17f on), movement = slowest unit + 1 (C3C),
  pillage (PTW 1.04f on), and see 2 tiles.
  - README-V 1.17f: "Armies now have the zone of control and blitz ability."
  - README-C3C: "an Army unit also has the "Blitz" capability (it can attack twice in the same turn), its movement
    rate has been increased by one, and units in an Army heal faster than they would if they were not within the Army unit."
  - README-V: "The only unit abilities that an army can inherit is mobility, and only when all units in that army have that ability."
  - README-PTW 1.04f: "Added the Pillage ability to Armies."
  - PEDIA `GCON_Armies`: "An army can "see" up to two squares away, due to its intrinsic scouts."
  - CFC-ARMY: "When no units have yet loaded into the army, the army will only have a movement of one."
  - Pillage (C3C): CFC-FAQ: "Armies in Conquests can also pillage without using up any movement points." TimBentley
    (thread 113864, #13): "Pillaging counts as a move for units other than armies."
- **Army combat strength (C3C).** The fighting unit gets a share of the others' strength:
  `Attack = A + (TA / N)`, N = 4 with the Military Academy, else 6, rounded down. Defense is the same with defense values.
  CFC-ARMY: "A is the attack of the unit currently doing the fighting." / "TA is the attacks of all the units added
  together." / "N is 4 if you own the military academy, else just 6." / "This formula is rounding fractions down."
  TA includes the fighting unit: Oystein's worked example in the article's forum thread
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/the-basics-of-armies.99688/, #15) sums the whole army, and he adds that terrain
  bonuses apply to the army's full improved defense. Arathorn (quoted by Puppeteer in
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/weak-armies-in-vanilla-and-ptw.489054/, #2): "The bonus to A is equal to the sum
  of the A values of all units in the army divided by 6 and rounded down". The Firaxis editor help describes the
  Military Academy's flag differently (see Disputed: EDHELP says +25%).
- **Vanilla and PTW armies get no strength bonus.** Puppeteer (thread 489054, #2): "Before Conquests an army was just a
  group of units that fought with collective hit points." / "A longbow army would attack with strength 4."
- **Armies get normal defensive bonuses.** alexman (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/58980-1.htm, #11, 2002):
  "Yes, the defender bonus applies to whomever is not the attacker."
- **Which unit fights.** PEDIA `GCON_Armies`: "An army uses one, some, or all its internal units to fight a battle,
  depending upon the course of the fight." CFC-CSE (Valant2, vanilla): "When an army attacks or defends the first unit
  continues to fight/defend until the unit is down to 1hp." CFC-ARMY (Theoden): "the strongest unit in the army will
  begin then descending down and ending with the weakest unit." A tested account (Theseus,
  https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/59461-1.htm, Aug 2002): the remaining HP "are divided between all units at the
  start of each battle event", and the strongest unit for the job fights with its share before handing off.
- **Units in an army can be promoted, but only the one doing the fighting** (community). Tomoyo (thread 99688, #6);
  Bagatur (#5): "units in armies can get promotion with blitz."
- **Army healing.** CFC-ARMY: "Armies heal at the rate of one HP per unit in the army." and "armies are also able to
  heal in one turn in a city containing barracks." CFC-ARMY also says armies heal in enemy territory without
  Battlefield Medicine ("This can also be done in enemy territory even before battlefield medicine."). Arathorn (via
  thread 489054, C3C): "Armies also heal in enemy territory (one hp/unit pre-Battlefield Medicine and two hp/unit
  after)". Vanilla was slower: Alan (thread 99688, #14, vanilla): "only one unit per turn heals, even in a barracks".
- **Army retreat.** Whether armies can withdraw is disputed (see Disputed).

---

## 1.5 Retreat (withdrawal)

- **Fast units withdraw when losing, unless the opponent is also fast.** PEDIA `PRTO_Horseman`: "move fast and will
  [withdraw] from combat if losing (unless fighting another fast unit)." (`PRTO_Cavalry` has the same wording.)
- **Since 1.17f, withdrawal is a die roll that depends on experience.** README-V 1.17f: "Mobile units now have to make
  a die roll to determine if they withdraw. Success is also modified by their experience level." Before that, fast
  units always withdrew (thread 100878, The Last Conformist: "In Original Release Vanilla, units always retreated if able.").
- **Retreat bonus by level (BIQ, editable since 1.21f):** conscript 34, regular 50, veteran 58, elite 66.
  README-V 1.21f: "Editor: Added Retreat Bonus controls to Combat Experience page." CFC-RULES: "Determines the ratio
  of retreating when a fast unit is fighting a slow unit." EDHELP *Retreat Bonus*: "The higher the number listed for
  the retreat bonus, the more likely it is that the unit will successfully retreat when losing a fight."
- **"Fast"** means more movement points than the opponent. CFC-CSE (Valant2): retreat requires higher movement and
  unused movement points. Jaybe (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/47749-1.htm, #2, Apr 2002, before 1.21f): "If
  both units have more than 1MP, there is NO retreat." He adds "The movement point and hit point rules are official
  (either documentation or Firaxian)" but cites neither. On that reading "fast" is base movement above 1, and two units
  with 2+ MP never retreat from each other. Whether a 3-MP unit can retreat from a 2-MP unit is UNVERIFIED.
- **Cases with no retreat at all** (CFC-RSTUDY, BomberEscort, #19, PTW): "Retreat is not possible (no matter the
  experience of the unit); these instances are:" / "(1) When the fast-mover has only 1 HP left (at the beginning of the
  attack)" / "(2) When both units are fast-movers" / "(3) When there is no available tile for retreat" / "(4) When the
  fast-mover is fortified in a city (or colony?)" / "(5) When the Defender has 1hp remaining." Item 4 matches an older
  vanilla report (Kriton, https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/35589-1.htm: "if your cavalry/fast unit is fortified,
  it will not disengage.").
- **Bombardment never triggers retreat.** BomberEscort (CFC-RSTUDY, #33): "Retreating does not apply to bombardment,
  since bombardment is a free attack for the bombarding unit..." (A unit damaged by defensive bombard can still retreat
  later in the fight, #35.)
- **When the roll happens (community-tested):** when the losing fast unit is about to drop to its last HP, the opponent
  has 2 or more HP, and the fast unit has movement left.
  - CFC-RET 104978 (Offa, #9): "Retreat possible if attacking unit drops from 2 HP to 1 HP, and is implemented before
    the attacker attacks with 1HP left." / "Zero chance if defender has 1 HP, or fast defender." / "Only one chance per turn to retreat, barring odd circumstances."
  - CFC-RET 100878 (boogaboo): the roll applies only if the opponent has 2HP or more, the retreating unit has 1HP, and
    it would have at least 1/3 movement point left after the attack.
  - A retreating unit survives with 1 HP and does not move (IbnSina, 100878: "Retreat does not require any special ground - no movement actually takes place.").
- **Retreat formula (best guess, not confirmed):** P(retreat) = attacker retreat bonus / (defender retreat bonus + 50).
  CFC-RET 104978 (Offa): "prob of retreat = (attacker retreat bonus) / (defender retreat bonus + 50)", described as
  "thought to be". BomberEscort (quoted in 100878): "(100*Attacker Retreat Bonus)/(50+Defense Retreat Bonus)" and
  "When the Attackers retreat value is 50 percentage points greater than the Defender, the Attacker always retreats."
  Measured success ranges for fast attackers in valid cases (same post): "elite fast-attacker is 55-75% retreat";
  veteran 50-66%; regular 43-56%; conscript 29-38%.
  The original study is CFC-RSTUDY (11,274 trials; the formula is Oystein's, #44: "Maybe the formula is 100a/(d+50)").
  It fits most results but not all (the 80-vs-80 case measured 56.75% against 61.54% predicted). Further findings
  there:
  - The slow unit's own retreat bonus matters. BomberEscort (#51): "The slow-Defenders retreat bonus does factor into the
    ability of the fast-Attacker to retreat." / "There is no way to create a slow-unit that will always block a
    fast-units retreat." Oystein (#23, vanilla 1.29f): "Seems like defenders retreat bouns decreases the chance for the
    attacker if above 50."
  - Edited bonuses above 66 seem capped. BomberEscort (#26): "Retreat bonuses 50 or under seem to work. Anything higher
    that 66% seems to get capped at 66%." Krayzeenbk (#22): "the 100% retreat horsemen continued to fight in 29.69% of
    cases". This conflicts with the "always retreats" line above, which came from edited values; UNVERIFIED.
  - The overall chance that a fast attacker retreats in a battle is the chance it reaches 1 HP first (with the opponent
    on 2+ HP) times the retreat roll (Krayzeenbk, #22: "multiply that by his actual chance to retreat").
- **Defending fast units can also withdraw** when attacked by a slower unit, using the same formula. CFC-RET 100878
  (boogaboo): the retreat bonus applies "both to retreating when failing to attack and to retreaing when failing to
  defend." BomberEscort (CFC-RSTUDY, #51): "They seem to use the same formula for slow-attacker v. fast-defender...".
  A defender needs a free tile to retreat into (case 3 above; Krayzeenbk, #22: "this is really only a problem when the
  fast unit is being attacked"). Offa's "Zero chance if defender has 1 HP, or fast defender" is best read as "against a
  fast opponent".

## 1.6 Defense modifiers

- **Terrain bonuses (C3C).** PEDIA `GCON_Terrain_Combat` and BIQ TERR agree:

  | Terrain | Defense | Move cost (BIQ) | Wheeled can enter (BIQ) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Grassland, Plains, Desert, Floodplain, Tundra | +10% | 1 | yes |
  | Coast, Sea, Ocean (and Fresh Water Lake) | +10% | 1 | n/a |
  | Marsh (C3C) | +20% | 2 | no |
  | Forest | +25% | 2 | yes |
  | Jungle | +25% | 3 | no |
  | Hills | +50% | 2 | yes |
  | Volcano (C3C) | +80% | 3 | no |
  | Mountains | +100% | 3 | no |

  PEDIA `GCON_Terrain_Combat`: "^Marsh 20% ^River 25%* ^Forest 25% ^Jungles 25% ^Hills 50% ^Volcano 80% ^Mountains 100%".
  Vanilla and PTW have no Marsh or Volcano rows (PEDIA-V and PEDIA-PTW tables stop at the 14 terrain rows plus River).
- **River: +25% for a defender attacked across a river.** PEDIA `GCON_Terrain_Combat`: "* This bonus applies to the
  defender if attacked from the other side of a river." BIQ/EDHELP *River*: "Default is 25."
- **Structural bonuses (C3C).** PEDIA `GCON_Terrain_Combat`:

  | Source | Bonus |
  |---|---|
  | Fortified | +25% |
  | Fortress | +50% |
  | Barricade (C3C) | +100% |
  | Town Walls (town only) | +50% |
  | Civil Defense | +50% |
  | City (size 7-12) | +50% |
  | Metropolis (size 13+) | +100% |

  "^Fortified Units +25% ^Fortress +50% ^Barricade +100% ^Town Walls +50% ^Civil Defense +50% ^City +50% ^Metro +100%".
  EDHELP gives the defaults for the General-page fields: *Town*: "Default is 0 (no bonus)." *City*: "Default is 50."
  *Metropolis*: "Default is 100." *Fortifications*: "Default is 25." *Fortress*: "Default is 50."
  City size levels (BIQ): town up to 6, city up to 12 (`maximumLevel1CitySize 6`, `maximumLevel2CitySize 12`).
  Vanilla's table has no Civil Defense row (PEDIA-V); PTW adds it (PEDIA-PTW).
- **Bonuses add up (they are not multiplied).** EDHELP *Fortifications*: "Note that this bonus is cumulative with
  other terrain and fortification-related defensive bonuses." EDHELP *Defense Bonus (Improvement Properties)*: "This
  bonus is cumulative with other improvement and general defense bonuses". CFC-CSE (Valant2): "Bonus percentages add,
  so 2 50% bonuses result in a 100% total bonus." Xerxes314's calculator code adds terrain, fortress or city size,
  river and fortify and then multiplies once: `defbase*(100.0+defbonus)/100`. WarpStorm
  (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/71511-1.htm, Dec 2002, PTW): "You add the bonuses first". See Disputed for
  the multiplicative view.
- **Walls: +50% in towns only, and land bombard defense 8.** PEDIA `BLDG_Walls`: "[Walls] can be built only in
  town-size settlements and provide a land bombardment defense of eight, and a 50% defensive bonus to units defending
  in the town. When a town becomes a city, the walls no longer provide a defensive bonus." BIQ: Walls `combatDefenseBonus 0.5`, `bombardDefense 8`, flag `canOnlyBeBuiltInTowns`.
  Walls do not add to the size 7+ bonus (Mike B., Firaxis, quoted by Catt in
  https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-strategy-archive/70027-question-about-great-wall: "It has no
  effect on Cities or Metropolises (since walls are ineffective for these pop. levels)."). README-PTW: "Fixed bug which
  caused walls not to be obsoleted by growing from a town to a city."
- **"Walls" means any improvement with a bombard defense.** EDHELP *Notes & Tips*: "Any Improvements or Wonders that
  have a defensive value against bombardment (> 0) is considered walled." alexman (APO-WALLS #10, PTW) explains the PTW
  bug fixed above: "In vanilla civ3, walls were defined as any improvement with either a non-zero defensive bonus," "or a
  non-zero bombard defense." / "Firaxis decided to change the definition of walls to be any improvement with a non-zero
  bombard defense." / "Unfortunately, they forgot to make all other properties besides the bombard defense" "(such as
  the defensive bonus) of such improvements become obsolete after size 6." / "Note that the bombard defense still
  becomes negated after size 6, even in PTW."
- **The wall bonus also applies against air attack; the wall's bombard defense does not.** alexman (APO-WALLS #1): "When
  you attack a city with a ground unit (or a marine), the defender gets the defensive bonus of the wall." / "When you
  attack a city with an air unit, the bombard defense of walls do not apply, but the defensive bonus does."
- **Civil Defense: +50% at any size.** PEDIA `BLDG_Civil_Defense`: "[Civil Defense] can be built in any size settlement
  and provides a 50% defensive bonus to units defending in the town. Civil Defense can only be built in a city that has
  a barracks." README-C3C: "Civil Defense requires Electronics".
- **Great Wall.** C3C: a free Wall in every city on its continent, and double combat values against barbarians.
  PEDIA `BLDG_Great_Wall`: "Doubles unit combat values versus $LINK<Barbarians=GCON_Barbarians>. ^Places a
  $LINK<Wall=BLDG_Walls> in each city of the continent on which it is built."
  Vanilla/PTW: doubles walls instead. PEDIA-V `BLDG_Great_Wall`: "The [Great Wall] doubles the effects of
  $LINK<Walls=BLDG_Walls> in cities that have them." Mike B. (Firaxis, via thread 70027): "The Great Wall doubles the
  defensive value of Walls in all Towns that have them."
- **Cities in resistance give no defense bonus.** PEDIA `GCON_Terrain_Combat`: "Cities with resisters do not give defensive bonuses."
- **Terrain under a city still counts.** CFC-CSE (Xerxes314): "Terrain under a city does affect its defense value."
  The printed manual (p. 110, quoted by royfurr in thread 7886): "Terrain bonuses are figured in BEFORE THE CITY SIZE
  AND WALLS TAKE EFFECT."
- **Fortify.** +25%; fortify, fortress and walls stack per EDHELP's "cumulative" wording. Some players believed the
  wall or fortress replaces fortify (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/defense-bonuses-question.21715). See
  Disputed. Which units cannot fortify is UNVERIFIED.
- **Fortress.** +50%, gives zone of control to units inside. PEDIA `GCON_Fortresses`: "They get a 50% defensive bonus
  if attacked. ^* They have a $LINK<zone of control=GCON_ZOC> and fire at passing enemy units without receiving return
  fire." Built after Construction (same entry).
- **Barricade (C3C).** Built on a fortress, +100%, stops enemy ground movement into the tile. PEDIA `GCON_Barricades`:
  "barricades automatically stops movement of a ground unit entering its square (unless that unit belongs to the same
  civilization currently controlling the barricade's square, or if that unit has a $LINK<Right of Passage=GCON_Agreements>
  agreement through that land." / "Barricades become a fortress if their square is pillaged." CFC-FAQ: a barricade
  "provides 100% bonus to defense as well as uses up all of a unit's movement points."
- **Radar Tower (C3C): +25% attack and defense to friendly units within 2 tiles, once.** PEDIA `GCON_Radar_Towers`:
  "The range of the effected area is 2 tiles. Friendly units within the Radar Towers range get a +25% attack and
  defense bonus. This bonus can only be applied once, even if multiple towers overlap."
- **Coastal Fortress: naval bombard defense 8, and it bombards passing enemy ships. It gives no defense bonus to land
  units.** PEDIA `BLDG_Coastal_Fortress`: "A [Coastal Fortress] gives the city a naval bombardment defense of eight.
  ^The fortress automatically bombards passing enemy ships." README-PTW: "Fixed Civilopedia entry for Coastal Fortress
  by removing reference to, "50% defense bonus from naval attacks". There are no direct naval attacks on land units --
  only bombardment." (The BIQ still holds a naval defense bonus of 50 for it, which per this note has no target.)
- **Attacker bonuses.** Terrain gives no attack bonus (CFC-CSE: "terrain does not give any offensive bonuses what so
  ever"). The only attack modifiers found are the Radar Tower and the bonus against barbarians.
- **Rounding of modified strengths.** Unknown. https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ3-combat-calculator.454569/
  (vmxa): "I think it is rounded down, after all modifiers are applied." Xerxes314 (CFC-CSE): "I don't know why
  anybody would think that there's rounding involved at any stage of the calculation." UNVERIFIED.

### Versus barbarians

- **Attack bonus against barbarians, by difficulty** (editor DIFF field, added in 1.16f). README-V 1.16f: "Editor:
  Added Barbarian Combat Bonus to difficulty level tab." Values from
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/ai-difficulty-level-bonuses.37490/ (Pyrkaige, read from the PTW/1.29f editor):
  "Attack bonus against barbarians: 800 400 200 100 50 0" for Chieftain, Warlord, Regent, Monarch, Emperor, Deity.
  Arathorn's later post in the same thread gives Demigod 25 and Sid 0 (C3C levels).

  | Chieftain | Warlord | Regent | Monarch | Emperor | Deity | Demigod | Sid |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | +800% | +400% | +200% | +100% | +50% | 0 | +25%? | 0 |

  EDHELP *Attack Bonus Against Barbarians*: "Determines the attack bonus enjoyed by any player (human or AI) against
  barbarians." Whether it is attack only or also defense is UNVERIFIED (the field name says attack). Xerxes314's vanilla
  calculator applies it both when attacking and when defending against barbarians, with smaller values ("Chieftan" 400,
  Warlord 200, Regent 100, Monarch 50, Emperor 25, Deity 0; its changelog says "Version 1.1 - added correct bonuses for
  Barbarians at multiple difficulty levels"). That is probably the pre-1.16f vanilla default, before the field became
  editable; UNVERIFIED.
- **Great Wall doubles combat values against barbarians** (all versions; quoted above). The editor help for the
  underlying wonder flag is narrower. EDHELP *Miscellaneous Effect Flags (Wonder Properties)*: "Double Combat Strength
  vs Barbarians: Doubles defense value vs Barbarians of city that the wonder resides in". See Disputed.

---

## 1.7 Bombardment

- **Bombard stats: strength, range, rate of fire.** EDHELP *Rate of Fire*: "Rate of fire defines how many times a
  bombarding unit will attack per turn." CFC-RULES: "Determines the number of times the unit initiates a bombard check
  when bombarding. (0-10)". EDHELP *Bombard Range*: "how many squares away a unit may bombard cities or units."
- **Non-lethal bombard can't kill: it stops at 1 HP.** PEDIA `GCON_Combat`: "Bombardment inflicts losses to the
  defender's health bar but never completely destroys them." CFC-RULES: lethal bombard lets a unit "kill units when
  bombarding, and to bombard units with 1 HP."
- **A failed bombard roll hurts nobody; the bombarding unit never takes damage.** freeciv thread (Akechi): "If attacker
  lose round during this combat, attacker bombard unit does not receive damage." https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/artillery-civ3-vs-civ4.145967 (search excerpt): a bombard "does not expose the artillery to harm."
- **Each hit removes 1 HP; a bombard is RoF separate rolls against the target's modified defense.** CFC-CSE (Valant2):
  "I assume all successful bombarbments on a military units only results in 1hp lost." Thread 19648 (warpstorm): "You
  fire twice. Each shot is tallied up individually." alexman (APO-WALLS #25, PTW): "If the attacker wins, the defender
  gets one HP of damage. If the attacker loses, nothing happens." / "Bombardment consists of as many rounds of combat as
  the ROF value of the attacking unit." / "So each bomardment can result in between zero and ROF hit points of damage."
  Against a unit the defense used is "the modified defensive strength of the defending unit (which always includes any
  wall and terrain bonus)" (#1). BomberEscort's calculator thread
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ-iii-combat-calculator-exe.75765/, #19) gives the chance of no damage as
  "(BombardAttack / (BombardAttack + ModifiedDefense))^RateOfFire" (he means the defender's share; his example is
  (6/10)^3 = 0.216).
- **Bombarding a city can damage a unit, kill 1 citizen, or destroy a building.** Thread 19648 (Park Ranger) lists
  "destroy an improvement," "kill 1 population point," and "damage a defending unit"; and "bombarding will not kill
  citizens if the city is only size 1."
- **Which target a city bombard hits depends on the version.**
  - Vanilla (early 2002): one third each. Whoha (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/44680-1.htm, citing korn469's
    tests): "it does a random check for what to target", a 1/3 chance each for population, building or unit, then
    "another random chance with the defense of the pop point/building/unit to determine if it actually hits that."
  - PTW (alexman, APO-WALLS, 2003): #25 "When you target a city, you have a 50% chance of targetting the top unit," / "a
    25% chance of targetting population, and a 25% chance of targetting improvements." / "If during an attack an
    improvement is targetted but the city has no improvements, it's an automatic miss." / "Similarly, if population is
    tagretted but the city is of size 1, it's a also a sure miss."
  - C3C 1.22 (CFC-BOMB122, justanick, #1): a fixed priority order by attacker type. Land artillery: "City walls are hit
    first." / "If there is are no city walls or the settlement has already reached city level, then land units are
    hit." / "If neither city walls nor land units are left to be hit, then citizens or buildings are hit," / "apparently
    with same probability." / "Ships and air units cannot be hit with land based artillery." Ships: "A coastal fortress
    is hit first." then ships, then air units, then land units, then citizens or buildings. Air units: "If air units are
    left in the settlement, then air units or citizens are hit." / "If no air units are left in the settlement, then
    ships, citizens or buildings are hit." then land units, citizens or buildings. Cruise missile: "Ships are hits
    first." then air units, land units, citizens or buildings. "Left to be hit" means units that can still lose HP: a
    unit at 1 HP no longer counts against non-lethal bombard (PaperBeetle,
    https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/what-makes-bombardment-fail.307328/, #5, C3C: "units are always targetted
    while they still have hp left to lose."). Lanzelot (page 2) suggests the order may be a strong bias rather than a
    fixed rule ("city walls are hit with 95% probability"); UNVERIFIED.
- **Civil Defense absorbs building hits (C3C).** CFC-BOMB122 (#1): "If a regular building(meaning neither a coastal
  fortress nor city walls) is hit and a civil defence is in the settlement," / "then it is the civil defence that is hit."
- **Building and citizen defense against bombard: 16** (since 1.17f; BIQ 16). README-V 1.17f: "Building and citizen
  defense against bombardment increased to 16." BIQ `buildingDefensiveBonus 16`, `citizenDefensiveBonus 16`.
  alexman (APO-WALLS #25, PTW): "Population and improvements are treated like a unit with a defensive strength of 16."
  Steph (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/defensive-artillery-in-city.329600/, #17): "if it's 16 and the
  bombardment strength is 8, then the bombardment has 33% to destroy the building." EDHELP still says "Default is 4"
  (text left over from before 1.17f).
- **Walls and Coastal Fortresses are a shield that must be broken first; their 8 is not added to the 16.** alexman
  (APO-WALLS #25): "When you use a ground unit to bombard a city with walls, you have to first destroy the walls" "(by
  damaging them as if they were a unit with a defensive strength of 8) before you can harm anything else." / "After the
  walls are destroyed, each subsequent bombard unit can destroy a unit, improvement, or population in the city." (#1):
  "If the walls win, then all improvements, citizens, and units in the city are safe." / "This happens only if the city
  is size 6 or smaller." Naval bombardment works the same way with a Coastal Fortress instead of walls (#1); against
  ships and planes, walls are an ordinary improvement (#7: "walls are just as likely to be destroyed as any other
  improvement in the city").
- **Great Wall walls make a town immune to land bombard (C3C bug).** Walls from the Great Wall are hit first and are
  rebuilt at once. Lanzelot (CFC-BOMB122, #13): "In a town with "Great Wall - induced" walls, all buildings and units" /
  "are immune to bombardment." / "(Because the wall is always hit first, and if it gets destroyed, the Great Wall
  immediately "resurrects" it...)". He adds that the Great Wall's own city does not get the free wall: "The town that
  builds the Great Wall does not get a free wall from that!" (tmn, #14, disputes this.) jarred! (page 2): "It seems the
  walls are immediately restored."
- **Great Wonders can be destroyed by bombardment until the owner reaches the Industrial Age** (C3C 1.22, community).
  CFC-BOMB122 (#1): "If the bombardement occurs against a settlement of a civilization that has reached the industrial
  age," / "then any world wonder in this settlement is immune against any bombardment." / "Before the target
  civilization has reached the industrial age this is not the case". zerksees

  Range 0 units can only bombard defensively (see next item). Air units use operational range instead of bombard range.
- **Defensive bombard ("Artillery Free Shot").** When a land tile holding a bombard-capable unit is attacked, each
  such unit (other than the one defending) fires once at the attacker before the battle.
  README-V ("Changes"): "Artillery Free Shot: When a land tile with a bombard capable unit in it is attacked, that
  bombard unit will take one free shot at the attacking unit."
  APO-ZOC (Harovan): "The defense bombard is used once in a turn per unit with this feature and only, if the unit isn't
  the defender itself."
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/zones-of-control.682034/ (Flintlock, #20): "Yes, defensive bombard only uses bombard strength."
  In C3C, Archers and Longbowmen got a range-0 bombard for this (APO-ZOC, Willem: "As of Conquests, Archer/Longbowmen units now get one as well").

  compared with the attacking unit's A-value, using the usual combat-success RNG dice-roll" / "if the DB hits, the
  attacker loses 1 HP before it engages its actual target." So each bombard unit fires once per enemy turn, not once
  per attack; README-V's "one free shot" fits that. Which strength of the attacker is used (attack or defense) is

## 1.8 Zone of control

- **ZOC does not block movement; it gives a free shot at an enemy moving past.** PEDIA `GCON_ZOC`: "Such units attack
  enemies that enter the zone of control without initiating a full battle." EDHELP / CFC-RULES: "Determines if the
  unit will automatically bombard passing units." APO-ZOC (Harovan): "In Civ2 or CtP the movement would be blocked due
  to ZoC, in Civ3 it is still possible, but the other civ gets a free shot on the passing unit."
- **Units with ZOC (C3C):** AEGIS Cruiser, Armies, Cavalry, German Panzer, Mech Infantry, Modern Armor, Mongol Keshik,
  Ottoman Sipahi, Modern Paratroops, Radar Artillery, Russian Cossack, Spanish Conquistador, Tank, and any unit in a
  fortress or barricade (PEDIA `GCON_ZOC`, `GCON_Fortresses`, `GCON_Barricades`). Vanilla also lists Marines and
  (plain) Paratroops and lacks the PTW/C3C unique units (PEDIA-V `GCON_ZOC`).
- **Trigger: an enemy moves from one tile next to the ZOC unit to another tile next to it.** APO-ZOC (geniemalin):
  the shot triggers only when an enemy moves between two squares adjacent to the unit.
  https://apolyton.net/forum/civilization-series/civilization-iii/110683-how-do-the-zone-of-control-work (CerberusIV):
  "It only works when an enemy unit moves from a tile adjacent to the fortress to another tile also adjacent to the fortress".
- **Each shot takes 0 or 1 HP and never kills.** Thread 682034 (Theov): "The outcome is binary and costs one HP."
  Ozymandias (same thread, quoting civ-wiki.de): "The control zone has no effect on units that have only one health point."
- **Hit chance (reverse-engineered, C3C):** `1 - (D*16 / (D*16 + A))`, D = the moving unit's defense with no terrain
  bonus, A = the higher of the ZOC unit's attack or bombard, using the strongest ZOC unit in the stack.
  Thread 682034 (Flintlock, #3): "1 - (D*16 / (D*16 + A))"; "The game will always select the strongest available unit
  to try to do damage."; Ozymandias: "The defense value of the moving units does not enjoy bonuses from the terrain."
  This implies low odds (for example A 16 vs D 2: 16/48 = 33%).
- **Walls in a town give its units ZOC; the effect ends at size 7** (community, C3C). Thread 682034 (Ozymandias,
  quoting civ-wiki.de): "All units in a settlement (size 1 to 6) with a city wall automatically have a control zone."
  justanick (thread 690690, #5, 2024), after tjs282 notes that fortresses give ZOC: "This is also true for towns with
  walls. Notably this effect is lost when the town becomes a city(size 7+)." Not confirmed by a Firaxis text.
- **One unit can take several ZOC shots per enemy turn** (unlike defensive bombard). tjs282 (thread 690690, #4): "But
  unlike DB, the same unit can make multiple ZoC-shots per interturn."
- **Coastal Fortress ZOC uses the same trigger.** tjs282 (thread 690690, #2): "The CF Zone of Control can/will only
  activate if a ship moves from one of the 8 (Coast) tiles" around it to another of them.

## 1.9 Movement

- **Terrain costs** are in the table in 1.6 (BIQ): 1 for flat land and water, 2 for hills, forest and marsh, 3 for
  mountains, jungle and volcano. EDHELP *Movement Cost*: "Determines the base movement cost for a tile of the selected terrain type."
- **Roads: 1/3 movement point per tile regardless of terrain.** PEDIA `TFRM_Road`: "units moving along roads expend one
  third of a movement point per square, regardless of terrain type." BIQ `movementAlongRoads 3`.
- **Railroads: zero movement.** PEDIA `TFRM_Railroad`: "Units moving along a railroad expend zero movement points."
  Railroads need Steam Power plus Iron and Coal (same entry). README-C3C: "Railroads will always appear under captured cities if you have Steam Power."
- **Rivers give no movement bonus in Civ3** (rivers run between tiles). Jon Shafer, in
  https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-general-archive/58801-rivers (April 2002, before he joined
  Firaxis): "Rivers are placed in between spaces in Civ III, unlike in Civ II".
- **Roads cross rivers only after Engineering.** PEDIA `TECH_Engineering` (all three versions): "{New Ability} Roads now
  bridge rivers." Before Engineering, a road move across a river does not get the road rate; how much it costs instead
  is not in the Civilopedia. Community claims that crossing an unbridged river costs a full movement point: TheBB
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/rivers-and-roads.120751/, #2, 2005, C3C): "a whole movement point is lost when
  crossing a river"; mastertyguy (#3): "It is also in vanilla". UNVERIFIED by a test. Bridges go when the road is
  pillaged (Mark Anthony, #8: "to destroy the bridge (available only after engineering), you must also destroy the road
  leading up to it.").
- **Wheeled units can't enter mountains, volcano, jungle or marsh except along a road.** PEDIA `PRTO_Catapult`:
  "catapults are wheeled so they may not enter $LINK<mountain=TERR_Mountains>, $LINK<volcano=TERR_Volcano>,
  $LINK<jungle=TERR_Jungle> or $LINK<marsh=TERR_Marsh> terrain unless along a road." BIQ `impassableByWheeled` is set
  on exactly those four terrains.
- **"All Terrain as Roads" (Explorer) and "Ignore Movement Cost" per terrain.** PEDIA `PRTO_Explorer`: "unarmed,
  non-combat units that treat all terrain as if it were a road." EDHELP *Ignore Movement Cost*: "Units with a terrain
  movement bonus will ignore movement costs of the selected terrain types." README-V 1.21f: "Updated All Terrain As
  Roads unit ability to work with water units."
- **Air units ignore terrain costs; water units pay terrain cost.** README-V 1.29f: "Changed air units to ignore
  movement costs of terrain types". README-V 1.21f: "Updated water unit movement to take into account the cost of the terrain type."
- **Naval movement bonuses:** Great Lighthouse +1 (PEDIA `BLDG_Lighthouse`: "all naval unit movement rates are
  increased by one."), Magellan's +1 (PEDIA `BLDG_Circumnavigation`: "The movement rate of all naval units is
  increased by one."), Seafaring trait (PEDIA `GCON_Strengths`: "Ships move faster and are less likely to sink in the sea or ocean.").
- **Partial moves.** A unit with 1/3 move left can still enter any tile. UNVERIFIED (the Civ3 rule for entering a tile
  with fewer moves than its cost was not found in a source).
- **Foreign roads and railroads give no movement bonus inside their owner's territory without a Right of Passage.**
  PEDIA `GCON_Territory`: "Rival civilizations cannot benefit from the roads or rails within your territory without a
  $LINK<right of passage=GCON_Agreements> agreement." PEDIA `GCON_Agreements` (Right of Passage): "You agree to allow
  his or her military units to move through your $LINK<territory=GCON_Territory> and use your transportation network
  (roads and railroads)." Roads in neutral territory, and roads in a tile that becomes yours when you take a city, work
  normally (the territory rule above; the War Academy's "Early Industrial Railroad Intrusion",
  https://civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/military/early-industrial-railroad-intrusion/, depends on this).
- **Units that win an attack advance into the tile only if it is empty.** README-V 1.21f: "Fixed bug involving extra
  movement costs if the unit can't advance after combat." The exact advance rule is UNVERIFIED.

## 1.10 Naval units

- **Curragh and Galley must end turns in coast; they risk sinking in sea or ocean.** PEDIA `PRTO_Galley`: "A galley
  must end each turn in a $LINK<coastal=TERR_Coast> square -- they are in danger of sinking if they end their turn in a
  $LINK<sea=TERR_Sea> or $LINK<ocean=TERR_Ocean> square. If $LINK<The Great Lighthouse=BLDG_Lighthouse> is built,
  galleys may safely end turns at sea, but never ocean squares." (`PRTO_Curragh` has the same rule.)
- **Caravel is safe in sea, at risk in ocean.** PEDIA `PRTO_Caravel`: "may safely traverse $LINK<coast=TERR_Coast>
  and $LINK<sea=TERR_Sea> squares. If it ends a turn in an $LINK<ocean=TERR_Ocean> square, it is in danger of sinking."
- **The sink flags are per unit: "Sink in Sea" and "Sink in Ocean".** EDHELP *Unit Abilities*: "Sink in Sea Unit dies
  if it ends its turn on a sea square Sink in Ocean Unit dies if it ends its turn on an ocean square". CFC-RULES:
  "can possibly sink and die without the right technology". The techs that make sea and ocean safe are given in
  PEDIA `TERR_Sea` (Astronomy) and `TERR_Ocean` (Navigation or Magnetism) for trade and travel. CFC-FAQ (Ginger_Ale,
  who also wrote CFC-SINK) says those techs remove the risk for every ship: after Astronomy "all ships (even old
  curraghs and galleys) will be able to end their turns at sea safely"; after Navigation or Magnetism "every ship is
  safe to end their turns in any tile." This conflicts with PEDIA `PRTO_Galley` ("never ocean squares", said of the
  Great Lighthouse only) only if read strictly; no test of galleys in ocean after Navigation was found. Community
  rule, UNVERIFIED by a test.
- **Sinking chance per turn ended in danger: 50%, or 25% for Seafaring civs (75% survive)** (C3C 1.22 test).
  CFC-SINK: "If you are Seafaring, it's 75% of survival, regardless of difficulty level, terrain, ship, turns spent in
  water." / "If you are not Seafaring, it's 50%." Tested on curraghs and caravels in ocean, galleys in sea.
- **Ships do not attack land units; they only bombard them** (PTW note above: "There are no direct naval attacks on
  land units -- only bombardment."). script.txt `#NOTAMPHIB`: "Only Marine units can attack from the sea." and
  `#LANDCONQUER`: "Only [ground] units can be used to attack settlements." Whether a ship can attack a land tile that
  holds only non-combat units is UNVERIFIED.
  - Known C3C 1.22 bug: AI galleys sometimes attack a coastal city directly (the "privateer bug").
    https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/new-attack-ability-galleys-can-attack-units-in-cities.677328/ (Takhisis, #4,
    "Civ3 Complete 1.22"): "a roaming AI galley finds a city of mine and sails up close, then declares war and attacks
    head-on." r16 (#2): it is a variation of the privateer bug and "does not require any ship in port." Not a rule.
- **Amphibious attack: only units with the Amphibious ability attack from a ship onto land** (Marines; Viking Berserk).
  EDHELP *Unit Abilities*: "Amphibious Unit may attack from a ship onto land". PEDIA `PRTO_Marine`: "They can unload
  from a sea $LINK<transport=PRTO_Transport> into any coastal land square, including enemy cities and enemy-occupied
  squares." PEDIA `PRTO_Berserk`: "allows them to attack enemy units or structures directly from within sea-based
  transport vessels." No amphibious attack penalty or bonus was found in a Firaxis source. Sullla
  (https://sullla.com/Civ3/strat8b.html, vanilla) says Marines attacking from ships "ignore city defensive bonuses";
  alexman (APO-WALLS #1) says the opposite for walls ("When you attack a city with a ground unit (or a marine), the
  defender gets the defensive bonus of the wall."). See Disputed.
- **C3C: any unit can step off a ship onto a coastal tile that holds only non-combat units and capture them.**
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/plucking-workers-from-the-coast.72176/ (Fanny Brice, #1): "ALL units can
  attack enemy workers along the coast right off of transports." Chieftess (moderator, #9): "It's a new feature to
  prevent the coastal blockades with units and workers, especially in MP games."
- **Landing.** Units unloaded onto land can't move again that turn (CFC artillery article:
  https://civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/military/how-to-use-artillery-defensively/ says landed enemy units "cannot
  move until the next turn"). The exact rule is UNVERIFIED.
- **Submarines are invisible** except to subs, AEGIS Cruisers and Destroyers. PEDIA `PRTO_Submarine`: "They remain
  invisible until they attack a surface ship ... other submarines and $LINK<AEGIS Cruisers=PRTO_AEGIS_Cruiser> and
  $LINK<Destroyers=PRTO_Destroyer> can see them plainly." README-V: "You no longer declare war by accidentally passing over a hidden submarine."
- **Privateers hide their nationality** (attack without declaring war). PEDIA `PRTO_Privateer`: "allowing them to
  attack and be attacked [without revealing the nationality] of the ship."
- **Transports.** Ships are boarded by moving onto them from shore or loaded in a coastal city (PEDIA `GCON_Transport`).
  Transport units can't carry other transports (Mike Breitkreutz, Firaxis,
  https://apolyton.net/forum/civilization-series/civilization-iii/53195-some-questions-for-the-developers-on-editing-and-the-civ3mod-file:
  "No. Transport units cannot carry other transport units.").
- **What happens to carried units when a ship sinks or loses** is UNVERIFIED (presumably they die with it).

## 1.11 Air units

- **Air units stay in cities, airfields or carriers and fly missions within operational range.** PEDIA
  `GCON_Air_Missions`: "Air units are not moved around the map like other units. Instead, they are stationed in a city,
  and assigned missions which they execute immediately against targets within their operational range."
- **Missions (C3C):** Air Superiority, Bombing, Precision Strike, Recon, Re-Base.
  - Air Superiority. PEDIA: "The plane attempts to intercept enemy aircraft that attack targets within the inner half of its operational range."
  - Bombing. PEDIA: "The plane flies to the target and attacks, sometimes affecting city improvements, and sometimes population."
  - Precision Strike. PEDIA: "Performed by $LINK<stealth aircraft=PRTO_Stealth_Fighter>, precision strikes destroy
    city improvements only, unless there are none in which case population is affected." README-V ("Changes"): needs
    the Smart Weapons advance; "Useful only against cities, this mission targets improvements."
  - Recon. PEDIA: "The plane flies to the target and reveals the map." It can't be intercepted (CFC-RULES: "(Recon and Rebase can not be intercepted)").
  - Re-Base. PEDIA: "a distance equal to up to Six times the plane's operational range."
- **Interception chance: 50% per interceptor, 5% against stealth.** EDHELP *Chance to Intercept Enemy Air Missions*:
  "Default is 50%." *... Stealth Missions*: "Default is 5%."
  alexman (Firaxis), APO-ZOC #11: "A fighter on air superiority has a 50% chance to intercept a bomber (5% if the bomber
  is stealth)." / "If it fails to intercept, it can try to intercept the next incoming bomber." / "If it succeeds, it's
  done intercepting for that turn."
- **Flak and Mobile SAM defend only their own tile.** alexman (APO-ZOC #11, as summarized): Flak and Mobile SAMs only
  defend against aircraft attacking their own tile. SAM Battery: PEDIA `BLDG_SAM_Missile_Battery`: "[SAM Missile
  Batteries] attack enemy air units that attempt to attack the SAM site's city." Anti-air stat, BIQ: Flak 2, Mobile
  SAM 4, AEGIS Cruiser 3, Battleship 2, Destroyer/Cruiser/Carrier 1.
- **Anti-air units (C3C): up to 4 per tile fire, each at one tenth of its anti-air value against the plane's defense.**
  Tested by BomberEscort (CFC-AA, 500 trials per case, C3C 1.00), with alexman agreeing (#13):
  - #7: "Chance Air Unit is Destoyed By AAUnit #1 = 1 - [AirD/(AirD + (AAUnitD#1 * 0.1))]"; the next unit fires only
    if the one before missed ("It is done as above because AAUnit#2 only gets a chance to fire if AAUnit#1 Misses...");
    "AAUnits must be sorted in decending order".
  - #5: "If more than 4 AA in a square, only the best four will defend..." / "Hit Points and Experience do not affect
    interception by AA." / "Stealth Ability does not affect interception by AA." / "Terrain has no effect." / "Radar
    Towers have no effect." / "A Defense of zero will result in always being shot down, this is why Stealth Aircraft
    now have a Defense...".
  - Results fit the formula: 1 Flak (AA 2) against a defense-2 plane gave "48/500 Destroyed----- 9.6%" (formula 9.1%);
    2 Flak gave 17.6% (formula 17.4%).
  - Same rule reported by justanick (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/air-battle-questions-only.565813/, #4):
    "In fact having up to 4 units will have a chance to attack you. However, only 0.1 times their attack value is
    applied." and Ozymandias (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/air-units-bombing-mechanics-in-the-open.678152/,
    #2): "The real strength of each AA unit is 1/10th of the value shown in the editor." / "The maximum number of AA
    units that are given a chance to shoot down the plane is 4."
  - CFC-FAQ: "the chance to intercept an air unit with stealth and without stealth is the same".
  - AA fire is a single yes/no roll: korn469 (https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-strategy-archive/120873-has-anyone-figured-out-the-aa-formula-yet,
    #12): "fighters vs. other air units does result in a hitpoint loss, whereas with AA units (either land or sea) it
    results in a simple yes or no situation".
- **SAM Battery: fires with the interception chance, then rolls A/(A+D) at full strength.** alexman (CFC-AA #13): "For
  each bomber, there is a chance equal to the interception chance for the SAM to fire" / "If the SAM fires, it has a
  A/(A+D) probability to shoot down the plane." justanick (thread 565813, #4): "However here the full attack values
  applies, but only in 50% or 5% of chances, that will depend on stealth or no stealth." BomberEscort's SAM-only test
  (CFC-AA #5) gave 3.6%, lower than this predicts; he called it possibly "a statistical fluke" (#20). Whether the SAM
  adds to mobile AA on the same tile: BomberEscort (#5) "SAM Missile Battery is cumulative with Mobile AA."; the list
  alexman quotes in #13 says it is not. UNVERIFIED.
- **Air units on interception stay on it when their carrier moves** (README-V 1.21f).
- **Air and sea units in a captured city are destroyed.** CFC-CSE (Xerxes314): "air and sea units caught in a city are
  automatically destroyed. They have no combat value." README-PTW: "Fixed bug that caused air units to not be destroyed
  if they are not in a city." Which units this covers exactly is UNVERIFIED.
- **Airfields (PTW+)** work like an airport for air units; one use consumes a worker; pillaging destroys them.
  PEDIA `GCON_Airfields`: "Airfields function in the same manner that a city with an airport would for air units." /
  "Airfields can be pillaged like a terrain improvement, which also destroys the airfield."
- **Helicopters carry foot soldiers only, 3 at a time (BIQ capacity 3).** Other capacities (BIQ): Transport 6,
  Galleon 4, Carrier 4 air units, Nuclear Submarine 1 tactical nuke.
  PEDIA `PRTO_Helicopter`: "Helicopters may carry foot soldiers only -- no mechanized units allowed."
  PEDIA `GCON_Transport`: "To board a helicopter a ground unit must start its turn in a city with the chopper and use the Load command button."
- **Paratroopers airdrop** from a city with an Airport (or an airfield, PTW 1.04f). PEDIA `PRTO_Paratrooper`: "When a
  paratrooper is active in a city with an $LINK<airport=BLDG_Airport> it may perform an airdrop." README-PTW 1.04f:
  "Added ability to airdrop from airfields." Drop range is the operational range (BIQ: Paratrooper 6, Modern Paratrooper 8).
- **Air unit stats (BIQ, C3C):** Fighter A4 D2 B3 range 6; Jet Fighter A8 D4 B3 range 9; F-15 A8 D4 B6 range 9;
  Stealth Fighter A8 D6 B6 range 12; Bomber D2 B12 RoF3 range 10; Stealth Bomber D5 B18 RoF3 range 16.
- **An intercepted mission always fails; the two planes then fight a normal battle to the death.** tjs282 (thread
  565813, #9, C3C): "Interception =/= Shootdown." / "(1) Is a Fighter scrambled to intercept the Bomber? (result based
  on 'Intercept rate')" / "If yes, Bombing mission fails, goto (2)" / "(2) Does the Fighter defeat the Bomber? (result
  based on relative A/D values and HP)" / "If yes, Bomber will crash'n'burn (Fighter may be damaged)" / "If no, Fighter
  will crash'n'burn (Bomber may be damaged)". Ozymandias (thread 678152, #4) quotes a FAQ: "If an aircraft is
  intercepted it will always fail to bomb the target even if it wins the air battle." The game's messages have both
  outcomes (script.txt `#AIRINTERCEPTED` "We were shot down by an enemy interceptor!", `#AIRINTERCEPTORDESTROYED` "We shot
  down an enemy interceptor!", `#AIRINTERCEPTFAILURE` "Our interceptor was shot down!", plus `#AIRSAMINTERCEPTED` and
  `#AIRFLAKINTERCEPTED`). Which unit uses attack and which defense in that battle is UNVERIFIED (presumably the
  interceptor attacks).
- **A fighter intercepts at most once per turn and needs a turn to activate.** CFC-FAQ: "A plane can only engage
  another plane once per turn." tjs282 (thread 565813, #9): "a Fighter can only be scrambled once per turn". Kirejara
  (#12): "Interceptors never launched in the round they are ordered to perform CAP". tjs282
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/air-unit-interception-range.678374/, #2) calls the delay a bug: the mission
  "does not activate on the interturn directly after being selected".
- **Several fighters on air superiority raise the interception chance in PTW and C3C, not in vanilla.** Catt (Apolyton
  thread 120873, #8): stacking fighters "did not increase the chances of interception" in vanilla, which changed in PTW
  and Conquests. Jaybe (https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-general-archive/72889-how-do-intercept-and-air-supremacy-really-work,
  #4) cites the PTW strategy guide: the chance "DOES increase as you have more units on Air Superiority available."
  alexman's per-fighter 50% roll (above) is the C3C model.

## 1.12 Nuclear weapons

- **Manhattan Project enables nukes for every civ.** PEDIA `BLDG_Manhattan_Project`: "Allows the construction of
  nuclear weapons by {all} civilizations. Nuclear Weapons can {Not} be built until this Wonder has been completed."
- **Tactical Nuke: bombard range 6, can be carried by nuclear subs.** PEDIA `PRTO_Nuke`: "They can be loaded onto
  nuclear subs and launched from the sea." / "The bombard range of a Tactical Nuke is 6 squares." Needs Aluminum and
  Uranium. BIQ: 300 shields.
- **ICBM: unlimited range, can't move from the city that built it.** PEDIA `PRTO_ICBM`: "An [ICBM] ... has an
  unlimited range" / "They cannot be moved from the city that builds them but can strike any target on the map." BIQ: 500 shields.
- **Using nukes angers the world.** PEDIA `PRTO_ICBM`: "Nuclear weapons, if used, have a tremendous negative effect upon world opinion."
- **SDI (small wonder, needs 5 SAM Batteries): 75% chance to stop incoming nukes.** PEDIA `BLDG_SDI`: "Offers a 75%
  chance of intercepting enemy ICBMs." EDHELP: "the selected Small Wonder will cause enemy missile attacks to fail 75%
  of the time." It also stops tactical nukes (https://apolyton.net/forum/civilization-series/civilization-iii/135536-strategic-missile-defense,
  MattPilot: "Infact it shoots down everything with the "nuke" flag.").
- **Blast effects: each unit in the blast has a 50% chance to die, and the city loses half its population.**
  CFC-CSE (Valant2, vanilla): "Has a 50% chance to destroy each unit caught in its blast area" and a nuke "reduces a
  city's population by 50%." WarpStorm (Apolyton thread 73776 below, 2002): "Every unit and building has a 50-50 chance
  of dying outright."
- **C3C 1.22 nuke effects (tested by justanick, CFC-BOMB122 #1):** "All nuclear weapons are immune against nuclear
  attack." / "All other units are destroyed at a chance of 2:1." / "All units that survive that loose 2 hitpoints." /
  "All units with 2 HP, 1 HP or no HP are killed instantly." / "Each building is destroyed with 50% probability." / "50%
  of all citizens are killed, the amount surviving is rounded up to integer." "2:1" is ambiguous (a 2/3 or a 1/2 kill
  chance); the vanilla-era 50% per unit fits "1 in 2". UNVERIFIED which. vmxa (thread 413455 below, #2) says
  survivors "lose half their hit points" and "Three hits will kill all units".
- **Blast area: the target tile and the 8 around it.** Proteus_MST

  The exact fallout (pollution) pattern is UNVERIFIED.
- **ICBMs can't be moved at all, in any version** (community). Fiddlin Nero (thread 413455, #7): "In Vanilla/PTW you
  can't move the ICBM at all"; vmxa (#8): "You cannot move icbm's in C3C either". README-PTW: "ICBM's can no longer
  auto-bombard."

## 1.13 Capture, enslavement, pillage

- **Non-combat units caught alone are captured.** PEDIA `PRTO_Worker`: "Note that workers may be captured and used by
  rival civilizations." Artillery with no escort is captured too (thread
  https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-general-archive/122803-siege-city-defense, Kef: "If they get
  captured, you're doing it wrong."). What a captured Settler becomes (Settler, or Worker(s)) is UNVERIFIED.
- **Captured workers are foreign and work at half speed** (C3C). README-C3C: "CAPTURED WORKERS: In order to
  differentiate a foreign (i.e., captured or enslaved) worker unit, it now displays different unit art than the
  standard worker." / "Note: Captured workers work at 50% the speed of regular workers."
- **Barbarians destroy the workers and settlers they catch.** https://apolyton.net/forum/civilization-series/civilization-iii/236659-unusual-barbarians
  (Quintillus): "They can't build them, and when they capture workers or settlers they are destroyed."
- **Any defense-0 unit is captured when an enemy enters its tile; attack-0 units can't take cities.** EDHELP *Defense
  Strength (Unit Statistics)*: "Note that units with a defense strength of 0 are automatically captured when an enemy
  unit moves into their square." EDHELP *Attack Strength*: "Note that units with an attack strength of 0 cannot capture
  cities." script.txt `#COMBATCONQUER`: "Only [combat] units can capture cities and improvements." / `#NONCOMBATANT`:
  "Non-combat units may not attack." EDHELP *Immobile*: an immobile unit "is not able to take any movement actions,
  though it may be captured."
- **You can only capture a unit type you could build; otherwise it is destroyed** (C3C, community).
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/captured-units-dying-instead-of-switching-sides.622068/ (JustLuthor, #1):
  capturable units "just die off, instead of becoming mine"; Oni Ryuu (#2): "The unit must be available to your
  civilisation and you need to learn the tech before you can capture it." / "The unit cannot have an attack or defence
  value." tjs282 (#3) narrows it: a civ whose unique unit replaces a capturable unit can still capture the generic one,
  so "it's only having the right tech (and the capturable unit having A+D=0) that is important." Oni Ryuu (#5): "Other
  nations could capture the cannon but not the hwach'a because it never becomes available to them."
- **Captured settlers stay settlers (Civilopedia).** PEDIA `GCON_Nationality` (C3C and vanilla): "Captured workers and
  settlers retain their original nationality as well, and, if ordered to join a city, become foreign nationals within
  that city." A conflicting recollection, eris
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/capture-settler-but-get-a-worker-instead.314474/, #4, in a Civ4 thread): "In
  Civ 3, you got two workers for capturing a settler." No test found; the Civilopedia wording is preferred.
- **Capturing a unit counts as an act of war** (UNVERIFIED in a fetched source; one search excerpt says so).
- **The "Capture" unit action only applies to capturable special units** (kings, princesses) in game modes outside
  scope. EDHELP *Capture*: "the unit has the capability to capture units which are vulnerable to being captured (i.e.
  king units, princess units, etc.)"
- **Enslave (C3C): 1/3 chance after each win to turn the loser into a set unit type.** PEDIA `GCON_Enslavement`: "A unit
  with the "enslave" capability has a 1/3 chance of enslaving a defeated unit everytime it wins a battle. ... the unit
  is turned into another unit type (as specificed in the editor) and is immediately under the control of the victorious
  player." Stock enslavers: Privateer, English Man-O-War (makes another Man-O-War: `PRTO_Man-O-War`), Mayan Javelin
  Thrower (makes a Worker: `PRTO_Javelin_Thrower`). BIQ `slaveUnitType: Worker`. Only the attacker enslaves
  (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/anyone-know-exactly-how-enslavement-works.107253, Willem: "It's the unit that is doing the attacking.").
- **Pillage destroys a tile improvement.** EDHELP *Pillage*: "If checked, the selected unit may pillage terrain
  improvements." Pillaged barricades fall back to fortresses (PEDIA `GCON_Barricades`) and pillaged airfields are
  destroyed (PEDIA `GCON_Airfields`). Pillaging counts as the unit's move, except for C3C armies (TimBentley,
  https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/question-concerning-healing-units.113864/, #13: "Pillaging counts as a move for
  units other than armies."; CFC-FAQ: "Armies in Conquests can also pillage without using up any movement points.").
  Which improvement goes first when a tile has several (for example road, then mine): UNVERIFIED.

## 1.14 Upgrades

- **Where:** ground units in a city with a Barracks, ships with a Harbor, air units with an Airport.
  PEDIA `BLDG_Barracks`: "A city with a [Barracks] can be used to upgrade ground units." (`BLDG_Harbor`, `BLDG_Airport`
  say the same for naval and air units.) README-PTW: "Added information about upgrading units to civilopedia entries
  for Barracks, Harbor, and Airport." The new unit's strategic resources must be available in that city (Tom's
  Hardware, https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/upgrades.167686/, "The Stare": "You must have any required
  strategic resources in that citys' resource display.").
- **Cost = (new shield cost - old shield cost) x multiplier gold. Multiplier 3 in C3C, 2 in vanilla/PTW.**
  EDHELP *Unit Upgrade Cost*: "if the base unit costs 20 shields and its upgrade costs 40 shields, the difference is 20
  shields. Under this example, then, the exact cost for the upgrade would be 60 shields (20 x 3 = 60)." BIQ
  `upgradeCostPerShield 3`. https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/upgrade-cost.94826 (Ginger_Ale): "times 2 (in
  Vanilla civ and PtW) and times 3 in Conquests."
- **Leonardo's Workshop halves the cost.** PEDIA `BLDG_Inventor's_Workshop` (all three versions): "Obsolete military
  units can be upgraded at half price."
- **Experience is kept, except elite drops to veteran** (community, consistent). https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/upgrade-or-disband.231677
  (Tone, #13): "elites are dowgraded to vets but all others hold their status." CerberusIV
  (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/90368-1.htm, #3, 2003): "if you later upgrade the unit it goes back to being
  veteran and can again be promoted to Elite". Velociryx (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/44520-1.htm, vanilla
  2002), on upgraded elites: "Win a couple more fights with them, and they're right back to their elite status." The
  Firaxis-relayed leader rule ("Each time a unit is upgraded, however, it can once again produce a great leader", APO-1GL)
  is consistent with an upgrade clearing elite status.
- **An upgraded unit is fully healed** (community; see 1.1 Healing: Pyrrhos, thread 266551).
- **Upgrade All (Shift-U) upgrades every unit of the active unit's type; fortified units stay fortified.** README-V:
  "Upgrade All: To use the Upgrade All order (SHIFT-U) you must activate a unit. All units of this type will then be
  upgraded." README-V 1.21f: "Upgrade all now leaves fortified units fortified."
- **Unique units are in the normal upgrade chain** (README-V 1.17f: "Civ-specific units are now part of the regular upgrade chain."; README-V 1.21f: "War chariots now upgrade to knights.").
- **Units inside armies can never be upgraded** (all versions). CFC-ARMY: "Units in armies cannot be upgraded." player1
  (https://codehappy.net/apolyton/threads/49454-1.htm, #19, 2002, second-hand): "FIRAXIS said several times, that
  UPGRADEABLE armes were too powerfull (unbalancing) in beta."
- **Whether an upgraded unit keeps its remaining moves:** UNVERIFIED.

## 1.15 AI and difficulty

- **Difficulty does not change combat odds** except through the barbarian bonus. CFC-CSE (Valant2): the difficulty
  level "has NO effect on attack/defense calculations." No AI attack or defense bonus field exists in the editor's
  difficulty tab per CFC-RULES and EDHELP.
- **The AI gets free units, not combat bonuses.** Thread 37490 (Pyrkaige, editor table): "Number of extra defensive
  units: 0 0 0 2 4 8" and "Number of extra offensive units: 0 0 0 1 2 4" (Chieftain..Deity), and "At Monarch and above,
  the AI civs get extra offensive and defensive units when they start the game."
- **AI barbarian bonus.** TheNiceOne (thread 37490): "the AI has still a 200% bonus against barbarians even though the
  human player loses its entire bonus on deity." This conflicts with EDHELP's "any player (human or AI)" (see Disputed).

---

## Disputed

1. **Stacking of defense bonuses: additive vs multiplicative.** EDHELP calls the fortify, river and fortress bonuses
   "cumulative" and Valant2 (CFC-CSE) says "Bonus percentages add". vulture
   (https://apolyton.net/forum/miscellaneous/archives/civ3-strategy-archive/64407-civ-3-combat-calculations-with-retreat-odds):
   "I believe the factors combine together as I've done above, rather than adding together to give a 70% increase".
   The manual (p. 110, via royfurr in thread 7886) says terrain is figured "BEFORE THE CITY SIZE AND WALLS TAKE
   EFFECT", which some read as compounding. Additive has the Firaxis help text behind it, and Xerxes314's calculator
   and WarpStorm ("You add the bonuses first") also add. No test separating the two was found.
2. **Fortify inside walls or a fortress.** EDHELP says cumulative. https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/defense-bonuses-question.21715
   (search excerpt): "the wall bonus supercedes the fortification bonus" and "in a fortress, there is no point in
   Fortifying." A related claim is that units in cities count as fortified automatically. Neither claim was confirmed.
   (Thread 287626, "Fortress vs. Fortifications", was read and has nothing on this.)
3. **Promotion against barbarians.** Theoden (thread 115547) and CFC-FAQ's table: promotion odds are halved against
   barbarians. Catt (thread 80836): against barbarians "the promotion odds do not apply" (read as: no promotion).
   Halving has two community sources.
4. **Army cost.** BIQ (C3C): 400 shields. CivFanatics FAQ v3.0: "200 shields". Probably a version difference (vanilla
   vs C3C); vanilla BIQ was not checked.
5. **Do armies retreat?** https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/are-armies-fast-units.84239/ (Longasc): "No, Armies
   NEVER retreat even if they have increased movement." Chieftess: "Armies DO retreat, atleast in C3C." README-V says an
   army inherits "mobility" only when all its units have it. DeepO (Apolyton 59461, vanilla): an army of Modern Armor
   "will not retreat from any other fastmover", which says nothing about slow opponents.
6. **Retreat formula.** Oystein's `100 * att / (def + 50)` (CFC-RSTUDY) fits most of 11,274 trials but not all, and
   edited bonuses above 66 seem capped at 66. The game's code is not known.
7. **Barbarian bonus for the AI.** EDHELP: the bonus applies to "any player (human or AI)" at the game's difficulty.
   TheNiceOne (thread 37490): the AI always uses the Regent value (200%).
8. **Leonardo's Workshop.** Civ3's Civilopedia says it halves upgrade costs (all versions). A CFC post (Randy, thread
   94826) says "Militaristic Halves the upgrade cost of units", and some posters describe free upgrades (Civ2-style).
   Trust the Civilopedia; the militaristic claim is unconfirmed.
9. **ZOC hit chance.** Harovan (APO-ZOC): the shot always fires and works like a normal attack. Willem: "more like 30%".
   Flintlock's reverse-engineered `1 - 16D/(16D + A)` (thread 682034) is the most specific.
10. **Seafaring and sinking.** CFC-SINK found survival depends only on the trait (50% vs 75%). Older posts tie it to
    sea vs ocean squares; the unit's Sink in Sea / Sink in Ocean flags decide *where* it can sink, the trait decides how often.
11. **Military Academy's effect on armies: +25% or a smaller divisor.** EDHELP *Miscellaneous Effect Flags (Wonder
    Properties)*: "Increased Army Value Each army owned by a civilization that has built a structure with this attribute
    has its overall attack and defense values increased by 25%." CFC-ARMY, CFC-FAQ and Arathorn: the divisor in
    `A + TA/N` drops from 6 to 4. tom2050's tests
    (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/increased-army-value-flag.424279/, #14, 180 battles per setup): "Didn't see
    any difference", possibly because the wonder was placed in debug mode. Unresolved; the help text is Firaxis's, the
    formula is the community's.
12. **Great Wall against barbarians: all combat, or only defense in its own city.** PEDIA `BLDG_Great_Wall`: "Doubles
    unit combat values versus $LINK<Barbarians=GCON_Barbarians>." EDHELP's flag text: "Doubles defense value vs
    Barbarians of city that the wonder resides in". Xerxes314's vanilla calculator applies +100% to attack and defense
    against barbarians. Unresolved.
13. **Vanilla/PTW army blitz.** README-V 1.17f: "Armies now have the zone of control and blitz ability." Puppeteer
    (thread 489054, #2): "Vanilla and PTW armies don't blitz; you're just seeing each unit in the army take a turn as the
    collective health goes down." The readme is Firaxis's; the post is a 2013 recollection.
14. **Militaristic and promotion.** PEDIA `GCON_Strengths` and the community tables say militaristic civs promote faster.
    Antal1987's reading of the C3C 1.22 code (CFC-LCODE #8) found no militaristic check in the combat-victory routine.
    He may have missed a check elsewhere; the Civilopedia is preferred.
15. **Can bombardment destroy Great Wonders?** justanick (CFC-BOMB122, C3C 1.22): yes, until the owner reaches the
    Industrial Age; zerksees (thread 278312, C3C 1.22) destroyed Sun Tzu's with a trebuchet. Dominus Romae (thread
    128868, #9, "At least in PTW 1.27f and C3C 1.22"): no. TimBentley (#12): the Great Wall itself can be bombed away in
    a town of size 6 or less, "a rather annoying bug".
16. **Marines and city defense bonuses.** Sullla (strat8b, vanilla): Marines attacking from ships "ignore city defensive
    bonuses". alexman (APO-WALLS #1): a marine attacking a city still faces the wall bonus. alexman tested; Sullla's
    line is a one-line unit note.
17. **Captured settlers.** PEDIA `GCON_Nationality` implies captured settlers stay settlers; eris (in a Civ4 thread)
    recalls two workers. Untested.

Resolved since the first pass: fast-defender retreat (CFC-RSTUDY: same formula on defense) and building/citizen
bombard defense 16 (README-V 1.17f, BIQ, alexman's tests) are now in the main text.

## UNVERIFIED / open questions

- The per-round formula A/(A+D) and 1 HP per round are community-derived (alexman's 2003 bombardment description
  assumes the same model). Rounding of modified strengths is unknown.
- Stack defender: the exact weighting of defense and current HP, and the tie-break (lowest attack? cheapest?).
- Promotion chances: no BIQ field; the 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 table and its militaristic and barbarian variants are community
  figures, and "two wins in a turn always promote" is a single opinion.
- Leaders: whether naval or air elites could make leaders before C3C; how "more than one leader in one game turn"
  happens (presumably only after the first one is used).
- Retreat: whether a 3-MP unit can retreat from a 2-MP unit; whether a retreating attacker keeps its remaining moves;
  whether armies retreat; the true formula and the cap above 66.
- Defensive bombard: whether it can kill with a lethal unit; whether it rolls against the attacker's attack (tjs282,
  "IIRC") or defense.
- Size of the "Bombardment in Ports" vulnerability. Whether the C3C bombard target order is fixed or only strongly
  weighted.
- Which units can fortify; whether units in cities get the fortify bonus automatically; whether fortifying speeds
  healing in a city without a Barracks.
- Movement: entering a tile with fewer moves left than its cost; the cost of crossing an unbridged river (one MP per
  community posts, untested).
- Naval: galleys in ocean after Navigation (CFC-FAQ says safe, the Galley entry does not say); what happens to cargo
  when a transport dies; whether ships can attack a coastal tile holding only non-combat units; whether units that land
  from ships lose their remaining moves.
- Air: which unit attacks and which defends in an interception battle; whether a SAM Battery adds to mobile AA on its
  tile; whether a stealth fighter can intercept (MoonWolf, thread 86619: "stealth fighters haven't the ability to
  shoot down incoming bombers/fighters").
- Nukes: whether "2:1" means a 2/3 or 1/2 kill chance; the fallout pattern; launch restrictions.
- Capture: whether capturing counts as declaring war; whether a Leader caught alone is captured or killed.
- Pillage: order of improvements removed.
- Upgrades: whether an upgraded unit keeps its moves. The elite-to-veteran drop and the full heal are consistent
  community reports but untested.
- Town walls giving ZOC: two community sources (civ-wiki.de, justanick), no Firaxis text.
- Every URL read for this section, with what it gave, is listed in `reading-log-01.md`.
