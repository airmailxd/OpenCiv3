// Goody huts: tribal villages scattered over the map at the start of the
// game. The first civ to walk a land unit into one gets what's inside, and the
// hut is gone.
//
// As in Civ3, a hut holds a city, a tech, gold, a settler, a map of the
// area, a conscript Warrior, barbarians, or nothing. What's inside is picked
// at random with the odds of Conquests' table for the difficulty level, with
// a table of its own for Expansionist civs, which never find barbarians (see
// BaseOdds and ExpansionistOdds).
//
// Which outcomes are possible follows the conditions Firaxis gave for Civ3
// (see https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/goody-huts.60142/ and
// https://civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/game-mechanics/probabilities-of-goody-huts-c3c/):
// gold only where there's no resource, techs only in the Ancient era,
// settlers only for civs with fewer cities than average and no settler of
// their own, and barbarians only for non-expansionist civs with a city and a
// military unit, away from any city, and not for units that treat all
// terrain as roads (explorers). Maps and nothing are always possible.
// An outcome that can't happen gets no odds, and the rest share its odds in
// proportion to their own. That is Civ3's redraw: "If the result is
// something that you cant get (ex: barbs for expansionists), there will be a
// redraw." (Oystein,
// https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/probabilities-of-goody-huts-c3c.93244/),
// "mit unveränderten Wahrscheinlichkeiten ... (gedächtnislos)" ("with
// unchanged probabilities, memoryless"; CivWiki, Bonushütte (Civ3),
// https://www.civ-wiki.de/), and a memoryless redraw gives each possible
// outcome its odds divided by the possible outcomes' total.
