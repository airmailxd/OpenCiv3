	// Trial switch "prey-war": Advanced AI only. Once its land runs out, the
	// rule planner names a much weaker neighbour on its landmass as prey
	// (RulePlanner.PlanPeace: the Target stance, an aggression shift and an
	// Offense focus). Without this switch that plan almost never became a
	// war: a declaration in peacetime comes only from Civ3's plotting rolls
	// (StockWarPlotting.RollsToPlot), where the Target stance only picks the
	// victim once all the rolls pass, and the shift moves one roll of a
	// dozen. A civ ranked fifth in power, short of the units per city the
	// rolls ask for, low on gold and under a government with war weariness
	// passes them about one turn in 1600. And lean-military capped its
	// soldiers, so the Offense focus built none.
	//
	// With it on, the prey gets a war campaign at once (WarCampaign: gather
	// at the nearest city, declare when the stack is ready, march, siege,
	// city after city). At peace the stack waits for at least MinAttackers,
	// or goes after GoAfterTurns with two thirds of the attackers it wants,
	// as a campaign already at war does.
	// Its cities build the attackers it is short of, past lean-military's
	// cap. The campaign is dropped if, before the war, the plan calls the
	// prey a friend or names other prey, and given up (with the usual cooldown) once the war goes badly
	// (PeaceAI.Assess Losing or worse); peace is left to PeaceAI. The peace
	// cooldown and locked peace still bar a declaration.
	//
	// What it takes, and keeps: on replays of the first version, a quarter
	// of the cities it took (4 of 17) flipped back to the prey 2 to 4 turns
	// later, at 2% to 8% a turn by Civ3's flip formula: big cities full of
	// the prey's people, near their capital, left with one unit as the
	// stack went straight on. So the prey's cities are scored by the chance
	// we keep them (FlipChanceIfTaken, KeepChance) and by their defence
	// bonuses (walls, size, hills), and one that would flip back too readily
	// even with MaxFlipGarrison units isn't a target at all
	// (WarCampaign.PickPreyTarget). A city taken keeps enough of the stack
	// to hold its flip chance to MaxHeldFlipChance, which the campaign then
	// doesn't take back; the stack waits in it for MinAttackers again
	// before the next city, and before the war it waits a while for its
	// siege engines. On the same replays none of 16 cities taken flipped
	// back.
