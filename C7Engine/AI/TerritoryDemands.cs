	// other's territory with military units. Units that violate this
	// agreement may be asked to leave" (manual p.~158). Each turn an AI
	// tells every civ it is at peace with, and that has no right of
	// passage, to take its units out of its borders, if they are enough of
	// a threat (see IsThreatening). Military allies are welcome.
	//
	// An AI told to leave withdraws, and its units are moved out at once.
	// A human is asked as Civ3 asks (Conquests diplomacy.txt): first a
	// warning (#AIBORDERWARNING), which they may promise to heed
	// (#USERWILLRETREAT) or answer with war (#USERWAR); then, if their
	// units are still there on our next turn, "leave or declare war"
	// (#AIBORDERWAR), which they answer by having their units moved out
	// (#USERWILLRETURNHOME, "<Your troops will move automatically.>") or
	// with war. "You are _always_ asked to leave or declare war on the
	// second turn" (Erlend Philip Wood, C3X thread, post-16132380). The AI
	// itself never goes to war over it: a civ planning a war declares it
	// when it's ready.
	//
	// Owner's ruling, 2026-10-31: AIs make these demands of humans, in
	// Civ3's form as above. This reverses the ruling of 2026-10-22, under
	// which an AI never told a human to leave.
