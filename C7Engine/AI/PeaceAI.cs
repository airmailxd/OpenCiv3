	// How an AI weighs up making peace, and when it asks for it.
	//
	// What Civ3 players report of its AI, which this follows loosely:
	// - It won't talk at first: not until the other side has hurt it ("You
	//   defeat a few of their troops. You take a couple of cities. Atleast
	//   3-5 turns", Chieftess), and "the AI seems to respond to threat more
	//   than to losses" (rcoutme)
	//   (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/when-will-ai-sue-for-peace.85975/).
	//   The refusal to talk is PlayerRelationship.refuseContactUntilTurn.
	// - It gives up cities only in a peace treaty, never in ordinary trade:
	//   "You can now only 'buy' cities by demanding them in tribute as part
	//   of a peace treaty. You cannot sell your cities to the AI, for any
	//   price" (Padma), and "the only time I ever managed to get a city is
	//   when I am dominating them in a battle" (Virtual Alex)
	//   (https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/trading-cities.177929/).
	//
	// Civ3's actual formulas aren't known, so everything below (the
	// strength ratios, the budgets, the chances) is OUR AI HEURISTIC, not a
	// Civ3 rule. Per the project owner, the AI gives cities no value in any
	// deal, never trades its cities away outside a peace treaty, and in a
	// peace treaty may give up cities when losing or demand them when
	// winning.
