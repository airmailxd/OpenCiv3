// Scientific great leaders (Conquests). "Each time a technology is researched
// for the first time by any civilization there is a chance that a Scientific
// leader will arise (this chance is increased slightly if the researching
// civilization has the "scientific" strength)" (the Conquests Civilopedia,
// GCON_Leaders). The chances are 3%, and 5% for a Scientific civ: "The
// chances of a Scientific civilization to get a SGL upon researching a tech is
// 5% - for non-Scientific civilizations it is 3%"
// (https://civfanatics.com/civ3/faq/), the figures the owner gave too
// (owner's decision, 2026-10-11).
//
// Only research counts, as the Civilopedia says: not techs traded, stolen,
// found in huts, or given by the Great Library, Philosophy or Theory of
// Evolution, nor a Scientific civ's free tech on entering an era.
//
// As in Conquests, a scientific leader is the same unit type as a military
// one (the RULE section's battle-created unit, "Leader"), drawn with the
// type's "SCI" art. It "can also be used to hurry the construction of any
// improvement (including a Great Wonder) of the city he's currently in"
// (GCON_Leaders); players report it can "rush anything in a city
// (improvement, wonder, unit)" (https://civfanatics.com/civ3/faq/). So it
// can hurry anything a city builds, any improvement, wonder or unit, not
// only wonders (owner's decision, 2026-10-12). It can't form an army. Its
// other use, starting an Age of Science, isn't implemented: in Conquests "it
// is bugged, and it doesn't work" (https://civfanatics.com/civ3/faq/).
