	// General.
	//
	// The CivFanatics Civ3 FAQ (https://civfanatics.com/civ3/faq/):
	//   "Each civilization gets 1 vote, and can vote for one of the
	//   candidates. At maximum, there can be three candidates: the
	//   civilization that builds the UN is always a candidate, and then if
	//   civilization(s) have 25% of the land OR population, they will also be
	//   eligible. If there are no civilizations with 25% land or population,
	//   then the civilization with the highest score becomes the second
	//   candidate. If a civilization gains a majority of the votes in the
	//   election, they become Secretary General and win a diplomatic victory!
	//   If not, the election is inconclusive. The choice for the founder of
	//   the UN to have elections comes around every 11 turns"
	//
	// For the second candidate the Conquests Civilopedia (DESC_GCON_Victory)
	// is followed over the FAQ's "highest score": "If only one civilization
	// is eligible, then the second candidate is the civilization with the
	// largest population."
	//
	// Every ElectionInterval (11) turns the founder (the UN's current owner)
	// chooses whether to hold an election. "it's 11 turns whether the vote is
	// inconclusive or the option declined" (MadScot,
	// https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/diplomatic-victory.53460/; in the
	// same thread Darkness thought a declined vote was offered again the next
	// turn, but the project owner chose 11 turns). UNVERIFIED (when the
	// choice is made): a human is asked as their turn starts and the vote is
	// held during the next turn; one who doesn't answer by the end of the
	// turn declines. An AI decides as the turn starts (AIHoldsElection), and
	// the vote is held during that turn.
	//
	// Choices the FAQ doesn't settle (UNVERIFIED):
	// - The first election is offered on the turn after the UN is completed.
	// - "Land" is the share of the world's land tiles counted for domination
	//   inside a civ's borders, and "population" its share of the world's
	//   citizens. Should more than two other civs reach 25%, the two with the
	//   largest share (of land or population, whichever is larger) stand.
	// - Population is the civ's citizens; ties go to the higher score (the
	//   civ's accumulated score, the FAQ's measure), then to the civ listed
	//   first. The UN owner never counts as the most populous civ, as it is
	//   a candidate already.
	// - A majority means more than half of the votes of every living civ,
	//   abstentions included.
	// - A civ may only vote for a candidate it has met; one that has met none
	//   abstains. Candidates vote for themselves.
