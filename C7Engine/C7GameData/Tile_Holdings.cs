// Outposts, colonies, airfields and radar towers: holdings a worker builds
// for its civ, which belong to that civ. A tile has at most one of them. An
// outpost, airfield or radar tower sits on the tile's holdings layer, so it
// doesn't go with a fortress or with one another; a colony has a layer of
// its own, as Civ3 lets a colony share its tile with a fortress (one of the
// Civ3 saves looked at has a tile with both).
//
// Outposts, from the Conquests Civilopedia (GCON_Outposts, TFRM_Outpost):
//   "Outposts eliminate fog of war. To construct an Outpost, move a worker
//   to any land tile in neutral or owned territory and select the Build
//   Outpost unit action. Construction of the Outpost consumes the worker.
//   The range of vision for the Outpost is 2 tiles on flat terrain, 3 on
//   hills and 4 on mountains. Outposts can only be used by the player who
//   created them. If an Outpost falls within the territory of any other
//   civilization, it will be destroyed. Outposts can only be built in a tile
//   that is empty, has a mine, irrigation, a road and/or a railroad. You
//   cannot build an Outpost on a tile with an Airfield or a Colony. The
//   "Build Outpost" unit-action becomes available after the Masonry advance
//   is researched."
//
// Colonies, from the same Civilopedia (TFRM_Build_Colony, GCON_Colony):
//   "A worker can establish a colony on any square that contains a tradable
//   resource. If the colony is then connected to a city, that city gains
//   access to the resource. A colony is necessary only if the resource is
//   not inside your borders. Note that when a city's borders expand to
//   include a colony, the colony disappears because it is no longer needed.
//   The worker is consumed by building a colony."
// and "[Colonies] ... enable exploitation of tradable resources that lie
// outside your territory. As with all tradable resources (strategic and
// luxury), you need a road connecting the colony to one of your cities to
// get the benefits of the resource."
//
// Airfields, from the same Civilopedia (GCON_Airfields, TFRM_Airfield):
//   "Airfields function in the same manner that a city with an airport would
//   for air units. To construct an Airfield, move a worker to any neutral or
//   owned land tile and select the Build Airfield unit action. Construction
//   of the Airfield consumes the worker. Airfields can be a re-base mission
//   destination. All air missions can be launched from an airfield ...
//   Airfields can only be used by the player who created it. If it falls
//   into the territory of another civilization, however, the airfield
//   becomes solely useable by the player whose territory it lies in (unless
//   they have yet to research Flight, in which case the airfield is
//   destroyed). Airfields can be pillaged like a terrain improvement, which
//   also destroys the airfield. Airfields can only be built in tiles that
//   are empty or have a road and/or railroad."
//
// Radar towers, from the same Civilopedia (GCON_Radar_Towers,
// TFRM_Radar_Tower):
//   "Radar Towers provide a combat bonus to units within their affected
//   area. To construct a Radar Tower, move a worker to any land tile within
//   your territory and select the "Build Radar Tower" unit action.
//   Construction of the Radar Tower consumes the worker. The range of the
//   effected area is 2 tiles. Friendly units within the Radar Towers range
//   get a +25% attack and defense bonus. This bonus can only be applied once,
//   even if multiple towers overlap. Radar Towers can only be used by the
//   player who created them. Should a Radar Tower fall into the territory of
//   another civilization, it will be destroyed. Radar Towers can only be
//   built in a tile that is empty, has a mine, irrigation, a road and/or a
//   railroad."
