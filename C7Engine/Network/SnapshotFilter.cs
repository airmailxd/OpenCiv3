// What a LAN host sends a guest's machine when it hides what the guest's
// players can't see (LanHost.HideUnseen), and a spectator watching as some
// of the civilizations: the snapshot, less what none of the players at that
// machine may know. They share a screen, so the machine sees what any of
// them knows. The host, and a spectator watching the whole game, have it
// all.
//
// The guest runs its UI, and parts of the engine, over what it's sent, and
// works much out again from it: what each player sees from their units,
// citizens' moods, trade networks and so on. What it can't work out from
// what it's sent, the host works out and sends with it (see HostFacts):
// whose territory each tile it knows is in, since the cities whose borders
// reach those tiles may not be sent; each player's totals (cities,
// population, culture, domination territory and turn score) for the victory
// screens and advisors; the tiles in the world counting towards domination;
// where each great wonder is, which everyone hears; and who has the United
// Nations. The scoreboard's scores are the game's history, which the host
// keeps and sends whole.
//
// - Other players' units on tiles none of the players can see now are left
//   out, as are invisible units (Submarines) none of them detects, and
//   those they can see lose their paths.
// - Tiles none of the players has ever seen lose their resource, barbarian
//   camp, goody hut and improvements. Those next to a tile they know keep
//   their terrain and rivers, since the map draws the edges of the known
//   tiles from them. The rest are sent as placeholder terrain, grassland for
//   land and coast for water, without rivers or anything else: that keeps
//   only whether they're land or water, and their continent, so that the
//   guest's units can still be sent into the unknown. The map's starting
//   locations are left out but for those they know.
// - Other civilizations' cities on tiles none of the players has ever seen
//   are left out. Those on tiles they know keep their name, size, owner,
//   buildings, culture and whether they're the capital, celebrating or in
//   disorder, which the map and the city's borders need. Unless one of the
//   players has an embassy with their civilization, which shows their
//   cities' insides, they lose their citizens (the guest places as many on
//   its own), stored food and shields, production queue and what they're
//   building, unless it's a great wonder (which the Wonders view shows) or a
//   city improvement like wealth that counts towards their borders.
// - Other players' research is left out unless one of the players has an
//   embassy with them, and their gold, techs and spaceship unless they've
//   met, which the diplomacy screens and the space race need. What they
//   know of the map is cut to their own territory that the players know.
// - What other players think of each other is left out unless the players
//   have met both, as are their reports on each other's capitals, and the
//   votes for the United Nations the other humans have cast.
